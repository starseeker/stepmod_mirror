			<title>Overview</title>
			<p>STEPmod has been successfully used to develop and publish a number of ISO parts. The parts are developed by constructing a set of XML, graphics and EXPRESS files for the part and then using a set of XSL programs to transform the XML into HTML which is then packaged and published as the ISO part. Once a part is published, a publication record is created that details the revisions of the XML and EXPRESS files that were used to generate the published HTML. Whilst this maintained a record of what source files were used to construct the HTML, no support was provided for using the publication record to retrieve a previous edition of a published part. 
   </p>
			<p>This tool has been developed to support the configuration management of ISO 10303 parts developed using the STEPmod framework. The tool builds on features provided by various CVS clients.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>The following has been enabled;</strong>
			.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>â€¢	Uniquely identified releases and versions of a part</li>
				<li>Proper identification is forced with minimal user effort</li>
				<li>Published / released editions can be locked to prevent further modification </li>
				<li>Information can be registered that identifies any supporting scripts that may have been used to create the part. (XML, XSL, XSLT, etc)</li>
				<li>Developers are able to retrieve given releases of the part</li>
				<li>The supporting scripts used to create a given part can be retrieved</li>
				<li>Checks can be made to ensure that the constituents of the module package or AP put forward for publication are valid Editions. I.e. that the file revisions used to build the package have been used to produce a release</li>
				<li>The tool has been designed to be easy to use by non-IT experts yet leverage exiting SCM capabilities such as CVS</li>

			<title>System Requirements</title>
			<p>In order to install and run the STEPMod Configuration Management tool the following system requirements must be met;.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The tool has been built and tested on the windows platform using Java 1.5 Run java -version to check which version of java is in use </li>
				<li>In order to use the tool you must have a sourceforge account with developer access to the stepmod project </li>
				<li>Currently the tool has been tested using putty and pagent these tools can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">here</a>
				</li>
				<li>The CVS client used is CVSNT</li>

			<title>Getting Started</title>
			<p>To begin unzip the application folder then run either the runme.bat or the runme.sh scritps.</p>
			<p>A screen like the following should appear;</p>
			<p>
				<img src="images/stepmod_config/application_running_1.bmp" alt="The application running"/>
			</p>
			<p>Before an index repository can be loaded the stepmod properties need to be set. This can be done from the tools > set stepmod properties menu.<img src="images/stepmod_config/application_Tools_menu.bmp" alt="Tools menu"/>
			</p>
			<p>A popup window will appear that looks like this;<br/>
				<img src="images/stepmod_config/application_setStepmod.bmp" alt="Set stepmod properties"/>
			</p>
			<p>Once the properties have been set the CVS connection can be tested by selecting the Test CVS connection.</p>
			<p>If the connection is successful the output area of the application will change and display the results of the test and a popup box like the following should appear click ok. The application is now setup and ready to use.<br/>

		<section>
			<title>Loading a repository index</title>
			<p>In order to load a repository click File -> Load default repository_index.xml. This will load the default repository index file located in the stepmod root directory. Alternatively you can choose to manually browse for a repository file by selecting File -> Load repository_index.xml</p>
			<p>Once the repository has been loaded the display will change to look like the following; the repository tree shown in the left hand side of the application and can be navigated. The pane on the right hand side of the application will display the information that is relevant to the module, application protocol, resource document or resource schema that is selected.<br/>

			<title>CVS</title>
			<p>In order to checkout / update a part; check the box next to the parts / modules that need updating or checking out. Then in from the menu bar click Selected -> CVS Part then select an option.<br/>
				<img src="images/stepmod_config/application_selectToCheckout.bmp" alt="selected for checkout / update"/>
				<br/>You will be asked to confirm that you want to perform a CVS action.</p>
			<p>Providing that the stepmod properties have been set correctly the application will perform the CVS action and the "STEPmod output window will display the following. If the stepmod properties have not been set then the application will notify you to which ones need setting.</p>

If there are no releases or publications available an error message will appear.</p>
