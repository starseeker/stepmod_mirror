------------------------------------------------------------
Outstanding list of tasks to be done
------------------------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------------------------
2) Each StepmodPart needs to read its attributes from the module.xml,
   resource_docs.xml, application_protocol.xml file   
   The resources are slightly different - they are read from the schema
   file.
   - Module almost complete - need to address the others

------------------------------------------------------------
3) We need to create a cm_record for each of the parts. Note - that a
   number have been published. We should retrieve these from the
   publication records. For testing purposes we should implement something
   that creates a new cm_record.xml. This can then be used in the future
   for the mk_module.

------------------------------------------------------------
4) To create a release, Once a tag has been generated, the cm_record 
   for the module needs to be updated. A new release record will be created and
   for the record added to the cm_record.xml file.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) Need to set up the GUI - the tree should read from the resoitory
   for the mk_moduleuplaoded to STEpmod 
   - need to show sorted by name and by number
