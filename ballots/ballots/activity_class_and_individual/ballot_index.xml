  Author:  Rob Bodington, Eurostep Limited
  Owner:   Developed by Eurostep Limited http://www.eurostep.com
  Purpose: A grouping of AP docs into ballot packages
           Note - to generate an ant build for this package, run:
              ant -buildfile buildbuild.xml
           This will create the build.xml file.
           Then run: 
              ant all
           to create the HTML version of the ballot package
           Note - the background of any module being balloted and the dependent modules
           can be set by the following attributes:
             background.image.modules
                The background of the modules being balloted
                When an AP document is being balloted as well modules,
                the default is a grey image stepmod/images/greybackground.jpg
             output.dependent.modules.background
                When YES the image specified in @background.image.dependent.modules
                will be used as the background image for dependent modules.
             background.image.dependent.modules
                The background of the modules on which the AP is dependent
                The default is a reference only image stepmod/images/refonly.jpg
             output.dependent.resources.background
                When YES the image specified in @background.image.dependent.resources
                will be used as the background image for dependent resources
             background.image.dependent.resources
                The background of the integrated resources on which the AP modules are dependent
                The default is a grey image stepmod/images/refonly.jpg

<p>This ballot package contains a module package that contains a set of application modules to record:</p>
<ul>
<li> individual activities with their whole-part, connection and involvement
relationships;</li>
<li>a library of classes of activity with their whole-part, connection and
involvement relationships;</li>
<li>the classification of an individual activity as a member of a class of
activity, and the classification of a relationship between individual
activities as a member of a class of relationship; and</li>
<li>the specification of the complete membership for a class of activity or a
class of relationship between activities.</li>
