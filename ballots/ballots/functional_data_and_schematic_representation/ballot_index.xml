  Purpose: A grouping of modules into ballot packages
           Note - to generate an ant build for this package, run:
              ant -buildfile buildbuild.xml
           This will create the build.xml file.
           Then run: 
              ant all
           to create the HTML version of the ballot package

  <p>This ballot package contains the application modules that correspond
  to conformance classes for ISO 10303-221 'Functional data and
  schematic representation for process plant'.  The conformance classes are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>functional data and schematic representation</dt>
<dd>which supports 
the definition of objects within a process plant and their
relationships, and supports the representation of these objects on
a schematic drawing;</dd>
<dt>functional data</dt>
<dd>which supports the
definition of objects within a process
plant and their relationships;</dd>
<dt>reference data library</dt>
<dd>which supports the definition of a library of classes for 
objects within a procreof object, and for relationships between these
objects.</dd>
