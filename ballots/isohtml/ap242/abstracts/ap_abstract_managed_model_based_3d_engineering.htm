      <p>
         The following are within the scope of
         ISO/CD 10303-242:&#8212;:
         
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>products of automotive, aerospace and other mechanical manufacturers and of their suppliers, 
                   including parts, assemblies of parts, tools, assemblies of tools, and raw materials;
         </li>
         <li>product manufacturing information, covering the design and manufacturing planning phase;</li>
         <li>process plan information describing the relationships between parts and the tools used to manufacture them 
                   and to manage the relationships between intermediate stages of part or tool development;
         </li>
         <li>product definition data and configuration control data for managing large numbers of variants of products during the design
            phase;
         </li>
         <li>data describing the changes that have occurred during the design phase, including tracking of the versions of a product and
            of the data related to the documentation of the change process;
         </li>
         <li>identification of physically realized parts or of tools, including assembly of physically realized products and recording
            of test results;
         </li>
         <li>identification of standard parts, based on international, national, or industrial standards;</li>
