      <h2><a name="Introduction">H.1 Introduction</a></h2>
      
      <p>Due to the current practice of direct use of the generic modules 
         from the STEP modules repository within APs (AP) instead of tailoring and adapting 
         them to the concrete use cases that shall be supported by an AP, the APs based on 
         modules are much more generic than traditional monolithic APs. Since the STEP modules are 
         modelled to be useable by theoretically any AP which all have 
         different requirements a lot of compromises were done inside the modules which often results 
         in complex modelling constructs. In addition, the lack of real integration work for the STEP 
         modules has lead to an inconsistent set of modules. In order to overcome these drawbacks the 
         concept of a Business Object Model to the STEP architecture was introduced.
         
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h2><a name="Intention">H.2 Intention</a></h2>
      
      <p>The AP 242 Business Object Model (in the following just Business Object Model or BO 
         Model) is an information model which is on a high level of granularity and thus is suited for the 
         communication with and understandability by domains experts of Aerospace and Defence and Automotive. 
         It consists of Business Objects (BO) representing major concepts and information requirements of Model 
         Based 3D Engineering in these domains and uses the vocabulary of the STEP modules where this vocabulary 
         reflects the terminology of the domain experts. For example, in the Business Object Model you find the 
         BO Part with explicit attributes id, name and description. However, the generic template object Product 
         of the modules is not part of the Business Object Model. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The Business Object Model is complemented by a Business Object XML Schema for SOA applications. 
         This XML schema is derived from the Business Object Model EXPRESS by an XML configuration specification 
         according to ISO 10303&#8208;28 that dives the generation of the AP 242 Business Object XML Schema. There is 
         exactly one configuration specification defined in AP 242 to avoid different variations of the AP 242 
         Business Object XML Schema. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Figure 1 gives the details of the Business Object Model approach and its position within AP 242. </p>
      <br><br><a name="figure_f1"></a><div align="center"><IMG src="../bom1.jpg" border="0" alt="Figure 1&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business object model approach within AP242"></div><br><div align="center"><b>Figure 1&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business object model approach within AP242</b></div><br>
      
      
      <p>The introduction of the Business Object Model is a new capability in the documentation of an AP. The 
         starting point for the development of the Business Object Model was the current AP 214 Edition 3 ARM,
          which provides the almost right granularity of BO. The functionalities of AP203 2nd Edition and the 
         new functionalities were the added stepwise. The ARM of AP242 looks more like the current AP 203 
         edition 2 ARM to preserve the consistency with other modular APs.
         The Business Object Model provides a view on the AP 242 ARM Longform. Consequently the Business Object 
         Model is defined as an EXPRESS model with a mapping to the ARM of AP 242. The Business Object Model and 
         the mapping to the AP 242 ARM is part of AP 242. The documentation form of the Business Object Model 
         includes EXPRESS, EXPRESS&#8208;G textual definitions and examples for the BO. 
         
      </p>
      
      
      <h2><a name="Implementation">H.3 Implementation</a></h2>
      
      <p>AP 242 has the following two implementation forms:</p>
      
      <ul>
         <li>Part 21 files conform to the AP 242 MIM Longform schema</li>
         
         <li>XML files conform to the AP 242 Business Object XML Schema</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>The relationship between the two implementation forms is explicitly 
         provided in AP 242 by the mapping specification (ARM to MIM, clause 5.1), 
         the mapping from the Business Object Model to the AP 242 ARM, and the XML 
         configuration specification (EXPRESS of AP 242 Business Object Model to XML schema, 
         new annex in AP 242). On this basis implementations can be real-ized to convert AP 242 
         Part 21 files into XML files and vice versa. 
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As AP 242 allows for both MIM Longform and XML implementations on the Business Object Model level,
          recommendations and rules are required, when which implementation form should be used, such as the ARM for 
         composite materials. Such recommendations are defined outside of this standard in dedicated AP 242 
         Recommended Practices.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>AP 242 describes the implementation technology without ambiguity. Example: the standard contains both 
         the Business Object XML schema and the XML configuration specification. There is only a single one 
         Part 28 configuration specification within AP 242. Currently for STEP modular APs, multiple different XML
          schemas are allowed and might be implemented.
      </p>
      
      <p>Figure 2 shows on the one hand side the relationship between the different data models of AP 242 
         (i.e., Business Object Model, Business Object Model XML Schema, ARM Long-form, and MIM Longform) and 
         on the other hand their relationships to implementations forms of AP 242 as well as the use case for 
         having a data repository capable of storing and retrieving data to/form this repository in both ways, 
         i.e., as a p21 file governed by the MIM Longform and an XML/stream file governed by the Business Object 
         XML Schema.

      <h2><a name="Basic modeling principles">H.4 Basic modeling principles</a></h2>
      
      <p>AP 242 BOM uses the principle of explicit modelling and uses the concept of strong classification 
         (as currently defined in AP 203 ed2 and AP 214 ed3, e.g., permissive list values for relation types) 
         for clearly defined domains like geometry, or analysis. These kinds of classifications shall be 
         explicitly defined in the standard. For product structure and other PLM/PDM type information AP 242 
         shall enable the use of an externally augmented classification built upon a frame-work template like 
         ISO 22745, ISO 13584, or other RDLs.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h2><a name="Capabilities defined within AP 242">H.5 Capabilities defined within AP 242</a></h2>
      
      <p>An AP242 Business Object consists of attributes and relationships and represents one or more 
         application concepts of the underlying (aerospace and automotive) domain of AP242. The Business Object 
         Model of AP242 is the union of all BO. It represents the scope of AP 242 &#8211; &#8220;Managed Model Based 3D 
         Engineering&#8221; by representing all relevant application concepts.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Business Object Model is divided into a number of subject areas or so called Capabilities. Each 
         Capability in AP 242 contains a number of Business Objects that belongs together from a logical point of 
         view, i.e., it serves the organization and summarization the underlying functionality of the Business 
         Object Model and is therefore a mechanism for modularizing the scope of the BO Model. Any two Capabilities
          are mutual exclusive, i.e., the intersection of two Capabilities is empty, and i.e., 
         each BO is exclusively assigned top one Capability. Figure 4 summarizes the Capabilities 
         defined within AP 242.
