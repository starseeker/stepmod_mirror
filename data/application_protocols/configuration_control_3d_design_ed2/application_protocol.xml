<purpose>

   <p>
The Configuration controlled design 3D design of mechanical parts and assemblies application protocol (AP) supports the requirement to represent occurrences or instances of parts in assemblies and in assemblies of assemblies.
</p>  
<note>It is an AP created entirely from modules and is referred to as a modular AP. 
</note>
<p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol for the use of product data within a defined context which satisfies an industrial need to exchange configuration-controlled 3D product design data of mechanical parts and assemblies.  
In order to specify the composition of products, organizations use many computer-based application systems.  
Integral to the definition of a product are the specification of its shape, the specification of its configurations and the applicability of its possibly multiple definitions to a particular configuration.  
This data may reside on one or more application systems within an organization.  
The integration of the data that defines the shape of a product with the data concerning its configuration is essential to an organization's ability to define its products without relying on redundant data in disparate application systems.  
In order for the definition of the design of products to be communicated, an organization must be able to share its product data with partners, vendors, and customers.
   </p>
	 <p>The activities addressed in this application protocol are described in annex E.
	 They include:
	 </p>
   <ul>
	<li>identification of a product to an organization's customers and of the components which comprise the product; </li>
  <li>description of the shape of the components of a product;</li>
  <li>documentation of formal change and release of designs for the product;</li>
  <li>tracking of the history of the product as it goes through the formal initiation, change and release process;</li>
  <li>identification of qualified suppliers for the product or the design of the product.</li>
 </ul>

	<fundamentals><description><p>This clause specifies the information requirements for the exchange of configuration-controlled 3D designs of mechanical parts and assemblies.   The management of the configuration of products is  addressed in this application protocol, and is concerned with authorizations and the associated approvals given by persons in organizations.  The structured list of materials or components needed to make a product can be exchanged, along with initial part design requirements as well as requirements for revised part versions.  It provides the directive for work to proceed on these initial or modified part versions.  
</p><p>
This part provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model, and also includes data about the different products that are sold by an organization to its customers enabling an organization to control the configuration of these products.  It contains the structure through which a part, unique versions of a part, and different design discipline views of a part can be defined. Information about an organization that is qualified to product a particular part in included.  Various documents and references associated with a product can be exchanged using this part. 
</p><p>
The different shape representations for products that are provided include solid modeling:  advanced boundary representation, faceted boundary representation, and constructive solid geometry.  Also, surface and wire frame representations with and without topological structures are included.   The validation of solid or surface exchanges can be facilitated using properties such as center of gravity and wetted area.  Associative three-dimensional text along with dimensional and geometric tolerances provide additional capabilities for product exchanges.

				<p>For various reasons, some entities may not be completely exported into an exchange structure. 
	There may be mandatory information in the AIM that has no correspondence in the ARM. 
	Sometimes an application may not maintain all the information that is anticipated for the data exchange. 
	Other times, the information may be maintained by a sending system but not included in the data exchange. 
	Nevertheless, the preprocessor must provide values for all mandatory attributes in an exchange file. 
</p>
<p>	When no data is provided by a sending system for a string value, the preprocessor shall use '/NULL' or the empty string ''. 
</p>	
To further indicate the reason why no data is provided, the following convention shall be used:
<ul>
<li>Empty string '' indicates user data managed by the sending system but not provided for data exchange; 
</li>
<li>String '/NULL' indicates user data in a mandatory attribute that is not managed by the sending system or currently not known or a mandatory AIM information that has no correspondence in the ARM; 
</li>
<li>$ is used in the physical file, if an optional attribute is not instantiated. 
</li>

<p>
The FILE_SCHEMA element of the header shall specify the name of the Express schema used and include its object information identifier (see annex D).
