 <abstract>
    <p>This document specifies the use of ISO 10303 integrated resources that satisfy the information sharing requirements
for design engineers, device design engineers, value added engineering data suppliers, design analysts, system engineers,
and manufacturing process planning engineers. The information is shared to transform the detailed design
of and requirements for either an electronic assembly or an interconnect substrate into either a manufacturable
description or an analysable description. Device data is shared to assure adequate product design and for source
control purposes.</p>

 <!-- Introduction -->
 <purpose>
<p>ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable representation and exchange
of product data. The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
product data throughout the life cycle of a product independent from any particular system.
The nature of this description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a
basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving.</p>
<p>This International Standard is organized as a series of parts, each published separately. The
parts of ISO 10303 fall into one of the following series: description methods, integrated resources,
application protocols, abstract test suites, implementation methods, and conformance testing.
The series are described in ISO 10303-1. This part of ISO 10303 is a member of the application
protocol series.</p>
<p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol (AP) for the representation of information
needed for the requirements specification of, design of, and analysis of, electronic assemblies,
interconnect, and packaging.</p>
<p>This AP includes information needed to support configuration management of the product data.</p>
<p>The detailed product data identify the functional and physical performance requirements for the
product in its intended environment. The functional and physical interface requirements define
the usage environment of the product. Configuration management information is part of the
product data.</p>
<p>The detailed functional requirements data may be either functional parametric properties data
or explicit detailed functional design data. The functional parametric properties data, used in
conjunction with an externally defined analysis model, describe the behavior of the product.
The detailed functional design data may be used to identify the usage of functional abstractions
as components and the connections between those components.</p>
<p>The detailed device data identify the products used in the design and their critical functional
and physical characteristics. The detailed device data are from the external or usage view of the
device. The functional device characteristics may be represented as detailed functional design
data, allowing the association of the detailed functional requirements data to available products.</p>
<p>The analysable description includes information, at a level of abstraction, for physically realizing
the product design. The analysable description may include the functional interconnect of
descriptions and analysis models. The analysable description may be detailed functional design
data that identify connections between components or material features in a design. Sufficient
information is included to support multi-level mixed functional or physical analysis of a system
composed of the assembly or interconnect products.</p>
<p>The detailed manufacturing capabilities data identify the material properties used as a basis in
the design.</p>
<p>The manufacturable description includes information for physically realizing either the electronic
assembly or interconnect product design. An assembly or a design may be used as a component
in a different design, with geometry providing shape information in a geometric context.</p>
<p>The electronic assembly description is technology independent and identifies the products used
as components and provides their placement and geometric shape data. These data support a
detailed analysis of the performance of a product in its intended environment.</p>
<p>The interconnect product design describes the materials composing the interconnect, their arrangement
in the interconnect physical structure, and their shape. The interconnect describes
the arrangement and shape of material features of the interconnect product design. The interconnect
description is technology independent.</p>
<p>Figure 1 contains the data planning model that provides a high-level description of the requirements
for this application protocol. This planning model was created from the in-scope
activities data of the application activity model (AAM). This planning model was used as a
guide in developing the application reference model (ARM).</p>
<p>This application protocol defines the context, scope, and information requirements for information
shared between device, system, design, and manufacturing process planning engineers for
transforming detailed requirements data, detailed device data, detailed manufacturing capabilities
data, and detailed functional design data into analysable and manufacturable descriptions
and specifies the integrated resources necessary to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>Application protocols provide the basis for developing implementations of ISO 10303 and abstract
test suites for the conformance testing of AP implementations.</p>
<p>Clause 1 defines the scope of the application protocol and summarizes the functionality and
data covered by the AP. An application activity model that is the basis for the definition of the
scope is provided in annex G. The information requirements for the application are specified
in clause 4 using terminology appropriate to the application. A graphical representation of the
information requirements, referred to as the application reference model, is given in annex H.</p>
<p>Resource constructs are interpreted to meet the information requirements. This interpretation
produces the application interpreted model (AIM). This interpretation, given in clause 5.1 shows
the correspondence between the information requirements and the AIM. The short listing of
the AIM specifies the interface to the integrated resources and is given in 5.2. Note that the
definitions and EXPRESS provided in the integrated resources for constructs used in the AIM
may include select list items and subtypes which are not imported into the AIM. The expanded
listing given in annex A contains the complete EXPRESS for the AIM without annotation. A
graphical representation of the AIM is given in annex J. Additional requirements for specific
implementation methods are given in annex C.</p>
