        The conformance option <b>Electrotechnical assembly design model with interface component</b>
        provides the capability for the representation of information required to support declaration of interface features and components in an assembly design. 
        This information is related to components that are considered to be internal to an assembly design by a design organization and is not related in this part of ISO 10303 to the interface control definition or usage view of that design. 
        The inclusion of domain specific model for interface component provides the ability to perform design rule checks on the implemented connectivity of the assembly.
      </p>
      <example number="1">
        A socket may be used internally in a computer to allow processor upgrades without replacing the motherboard, but with a requirement for temporary partial disassembly of the computer. 
        In this case the socket would be considered to be an interface component from the viewpoint of the computer assembler.
      </example>
      <example number="2">
        An ethernet socket provided on the motherboard that allows an end user to connect the assembled computer to an ethernet cable would not be modeled as an interface component since the ethernet cable is not internal to the assembled computer.
      </example>
      <note>
        The classification of a part occurrence as an interface component depends on the design application and intent. 
        The same product may be represented as an interface component in one design if its features are not accessible externally to the system and can be 
        represented as a connector in another design where the external features are available.

        This option is foundational for verification and validation that the actual design meets detailed functional specifications by providing a mechanism for a design organization to make explicit assertions about the detailed joints that are implemented in the physical design.

      <example number="1">
        A connector that is placed in an assembly using a coordinate transformation is a geometric representation of the relationship between the connector as a whole and the assembly it is helping to compose. The transformation makes no assertions about the detailed relationships between the features of the connector and the other item or items in the assembly that it is mated with during the assembly realization process. This module provides the ability to assert the relationship of each feature of that connector to a corresponding feature on a printed circuit board. A application may use that set of asserted relationships to verify the connector actually connects what it is intended to connect.

        The conformance option <b>Layered interconnect design model with layer position in a 2d context</b>
        provides the capability for the representation of the location of a layer in an interconnect substrate using planar geometric models.
        This conformance option is provided specifically for the case where the horizontal extent of the various stratum are not substantially
        identical and must be individually positioned in a planar context. In this option, the individual shape of the stratum override the
        overall shape normally provided.
      </p>
      <note>
        This option is not intended to support the use case where construction lines are used to guarantee that features on a stratum are accurately
        represented for manufacturing purposes and those construction lines fall outside the physical boundary of the delivered interconnect substrate.
        That use case is supported by the basic pattern geometry supported by this part of ISO 10303.
