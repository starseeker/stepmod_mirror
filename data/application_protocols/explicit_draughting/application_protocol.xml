 <!-- Introduction -->
	<purpose>
	<p>ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
	representation and exchange of product data. The objective is to provide
	a neutral mechanism capable of describing product data throughout the life
	cycle of a product independent from any particular system. The nature of 
	this description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange, 
	but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving.
	</p>
	<p>
	This International Standard is organized as a series of parts, each published 
	separately. The parts of ISO 10303 fall into one of the following series: 
	description methods, integrated resources, application protocols, abstract test suites, 
	implementation methods, and conformance testing. The series are described 
	in ISO 10303{1. This part of ISO 10303 is a member of the application protocols series.
	</p>
	<p>
	This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol (AP) for the exchange 
	of technical CAD drawings consisting of two-dimensional geometry and 
	two-dimensional annotation. This part satisfies the need for the exchange 
	of such drawings within and between organizations, especially those 
	operating in the mechanical engineering and architectural, engineering, and 
	construction industrial sectors.
	</p>
	<p>
	The exchange of such drawings enables the communication of product data 
	during all stages of the lifecycle of a product for any product type. 
	This product data, in the form of a CAD drawing, may be interpreted by 
	people according to accepted international, national, or organization 
	draughting standards. The use of CAD drawings for the purposes of the 
	communication of product data is common practice in many industries. 
	This product data may also be interpreted by appropriate CAx systems for
	use in applications other than draughting.
	</p>
	<p>
	The nominal shape of a product is represented by geometry defined in two dimensions. 
	Such representations may be the result of the application of a projection 
	transformation on a three-dimensional shape representation; such threedimensional 
	shape representations, and the projection transformations that may be applied 
	to produce a two-dimensional representation, lie outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303.
	</p>
	<p>
	This application protocol makes use of two fundamental concepts which 
	relate to the creation, revision, storage, and use of drawings produced using CAD systems.
	</p>
	<p>
	A CAD drawing is a digital representation of a drawing and may include the following, 
	in addition to lines and text presented on the face of the drawing:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>representations of the shape(s) of the product(s) depicted by the drawing;</li>
	  <li>information used in administering drawings for purposes of configuration control, audit trails, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	The use of the shape representation present in the CAD drawing depends 
	on the interpretation of a draughtsman or engineer viewing the drawing. 
	For this reason the concept of a draughting shape model is included. 
	A draughting shape model is a representation of the shape of a product 
	whose interpretation is determined through visual inspection of the 
	drawings that depict the product.
	</p>
	<example>
	An architectural drawing may contain both isometric and perspective views 
	of a building. The use of the two-dimensional representations depicted 
	in these views depends on the knowledge, in the mind of a designer, that 
	the lengths of lines may be measured or calculated in the isometric view 
	but not in the perspective view.
	</example>
	<p>
	This draughting shape model is also a nominal shape model; no information 
	regarding tolerances is included in the draughting shape model.
	</p>
	<p>
	Figure <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:dataplanningmodel">1</clause_ref> contains the data planning model that provides a high-level 
	description of the general structure of this application protocol, as 
	well as the relationships between the basic data components.
	</p>
		<figure id="dataplanningmodel">
			<title>Data planning model</title>
			<img src="data_planning_model.gif"/>
		</figure>
	<p>
	The data planning model illustrates that a product may be described by 
	a draughting shape model. The draughting shape model is a two-dimensional 
	model generated by a CAD system. This CAD model is composed of geometry 
	which represents the shape of the product and may also include annotation. 
	The product is documented by a drawing.
	</p>
	<p>
	The drawing is composed of drawing sheets that contain annotation and 
	drawing views. The drawing views are two-dimensional views of the draughting 
	shape model that may include additional annotation. Therefore, the drawing 
	is a presentation of the draughting shape model.
	</p>
	<p>
	Annotation, in the form of text and symbology, provides additional product 
	data that is needed to fully define the product or interpret the drawing. 
	The scope of this application protocol constrains the dimensionality of 
	all data found within it to be two-dimensional only.
	</p>
	<p>
	This application protocol defines the context, scope, and information 
	requirements for exchange of geometrically explicit two-dimensional 
	technical CAD drawings with explicit annotation and specifies the integrated 
	resources necessary to satisfy these requirements.
	</p>
	<p>
	Application protocols provide the basis for developing implementations of 
	ISO 10303 and abstract test suites for the conformance testing of AP implementations.
	</p>
	<p>
	<clause_ref linkend="scope"/> defines the scope of the application protocol and summarizes the 
	functionality and data covered by the AP. An application activity model 
	that is the basis for the definition of the scope is provided in <clause_ref linkend="aam"/>
	The information requirements of the application are specified in <clause_ref linkend="inforeqt"/> 
	using terminology appropriate to the application. A graphical representation 
	of the information requirements, referred to as the application reference 
	model, is given in Annex G.
	</p>
	<p>
	Resource constructs are interpreted to meet the information requirements. 
	This interpretation produces the application interpreted model (AIM). 
	This interpretation, given in 5.1, shows the correspondence between the 
	information requirements and the AIM. The short listing of the AIM specifies
	the interface to the integrated resources and is given in 5.2. Note that the 
	definitions and EXPRESS provided in the integrated resources for constructs 
	used in the AIM may include select list items and subtypes which are not 
	imported into the AIM. The expanded listing given in Annex A contains the
	complete EXPRESS for the AIM without annotation. A graphical representation 
	of the AIM is given in Annex H. Additional requirements for specific 
	implementation methods are given in <clause_ref linkend="imp_meths"/>.
	<clause_ref linkend="mim_short_names"/>
