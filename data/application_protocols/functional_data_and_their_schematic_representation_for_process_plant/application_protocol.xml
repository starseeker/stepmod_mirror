   </data_plan>
<p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol (AP) for
the functional design of systems within a process plant, and for 
the engineering specifications of system components to be used for
subsequent procurement or component design.</p>

<p>The principal activities that take place during the life of a
process plant, and the flows of information and material between 
them, are shown in 
<module_ref linkend="functional_data_and_their_schematic_representation_for_process_plant:introduction:figure:F1">Figure 1</module_ref>. 
The two activities, which are principally addressed by this 
application protocol are:</p>
<ul>
<li>conceptual design; and</li>
<li>detailed design.</li>
</ul>

<figure number="1" id="F1">
<title>High level activity model</title>
<img src="high_level_activity_model.gif"/>
</figure>

<p>The schema for this part of ISO 10303 is specified by
reference to the application module that is appropriate to the conformance
class, as defined in <module_ref linkend="functional_data_and_their_schematic_representation_for_process_plant:6_ccs">clause 6</module_ref>.</p>
<p>Each module references further modules. The hierarchy of module dependencies
defined by these references is shown in the module dependence 
diagrams in
<module_ref linkend="functional_data_and_their_schematic_representation_for_process_plant:annex_tech_disc">Technical discussion</module_ref>.</p>

<p>There is a substantial overlap in scope between this
part of ISO 10303 and ISO 10303-227. The overlap in scope is 
summarised by
<module_ref linkend="functional_data_and_their_schematic_representation_for_process_plant:introduction:figure:F2">Figure 2</module_ref>.
