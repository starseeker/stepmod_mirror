<p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol (AP) for
the functional design of systems within a process plant, and for 
the engineering specifications of system components to be used for
subsequent procurement or component design.</p>

<p>The principal activities that take place during the life of a
process plant, and the flows of information and material between 
them, are shown in 
<clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:F1">Figure 1</clause_ref>. 
The two activities, which are principally addressed by this 
application protocol are:</p>
<ul>
<li>conceptual design; and</li>
<li>detailed design.</li>
</ul>

<figure number="1" id="F1">
<title>High level activity model</title>
<img src="high_level_activity_model.gif"/>
</figure>

<p>The schema for this part of ISO 10303 is specified by
reference to the application module that is appropriate to the conformance
class, as defined in 
<clause_ref linkend="conformance">clause 6</clause_ref>.
</p>

<p>Each module references further modules. The hierarchy of module dependencies
defined by these references is shown in the tree of
module dependence diagrams beginning with
<clause_ref linkend="inforeqt:data_plan:1">Figure 4</clause_ref>.</p>

<p>There is a substantial overlap in scope between this
part of ISO 10303 and ISO 10303-227. The overlap in scope is 
summarised by
<clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:F2">Figure 2</clause_ref>. 
</p>

<figure number="2" id="F2">
<title>Process plant AP coverage and overlaps</title>

</figure>

<p>With the exception of the schematic representation, the
engineering content of this part of ISO 10303 is derived from
ISO 15926-2:2003. A subset of ISO 15926-2 has been expressed
using the methodology of an ISO 10303 application protocol.</p>

<p>The subset has been chosen to support the exchange of process
plant functional data at a particular instant during the life of
a process plant. This part of ISO 10303 does not support
information about the way in which data has changed during the
life of a process plant.</p>

<p>Data defined by this part of ISO 10303 can be merged 
with other data within a life cycle data repository structured
according to ISO 15926-2.</p>

<p>If an ARM entity within an Application Module referenced by 
this part of ISO 10303, corresponds to an entity in
ISO 15926-2, then 0that correspondance is indicated by a note.</p>

<reqtover module="product_structure_and_classification">
<description>
<p><module_ref linkend="product_structure_and_classification:introduction">ISO 10303-1156</module_ref>
specifies an application module for the recording of physical items
or products within a process plant. Physical items within the scope of this
module are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>material objects within a process plant;</p>
<p>These include physical assets ranging from major items such as 
vessel, pumps, pipes and valves to small components within 
assemblies. The major items will usually have unique asset 
identifiers, but the small items may not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>functional objects within a process plant;</p>
<p>These include physical objects that are defined by their role,
rather than their material realisation. Such functional objects
are usually identified by a tag rather than by an asset identifier.
These tags may be assigned at an early stage in the design process
before any material implementation exists.</p>
<p>Operational activities can be concerned only with the
functional objects. For example, the pump with tag P_101 may be
operated on Friday and again on Monday, even though the asset that
performs the role has been changed over the weekend. To support 
operational views, it is possible to record both:</p>
<ul>
<li>the functional object with its tag, which persists for long
periods during the life of the plant; and</li>
<li>the material object with its asset identifier, which is installed
to implement the functional object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This module supports the recording of classes of
physical item, and the classification of individual physical items.
Most of the classes are equally valid for material and
functional objects within a process plant. For example, either a
functional item with a tag, or a material item with an asset
identifier can be classified as a centrifugal pump.</p>
<p>This module supports the recording of 
composition and connectivity. An individual physical item can be
broken down into interconnected sub-assemblies and 
sub-sub-assemblies as required.</p>

<p><module_ref linkend="activity_structure_and_classification:introduction">ISO 10303-1169</module_ref>
specifies an application module for the recording of processes
or activities carried out by people or equipment within a process plant. 
The things involved in aan activity, and the role that they play can
be specified. A thing involved in an activity can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>an input or output batch of process material;</li>
<li>an equipment item that performs an activity; or</li>
<li>a person or organisation that performs an activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>This module supports the recording of classes of
activity, and the classification of individual activities. A
'role' is a class of involvement and is defined for a class of
activity.</p>
<p>This module supports the recording of 
composition and connectivity. An individual activity can be
broken down into interconnected sub-activities and 
sub-sub-activities as required. A connection between activities 
implies a flow of something between them. This can be a flow
of process material, energy or information.</p>

<p>Schematics within scope include:</p>
<ul>
<li>P&amp;ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram): In a schematic

usually stand for pipes or cables. These 
physical items can be either functional objects with tags or
material objects with asset identifiers.</li>

usually stand for flows between processes. A process is 
often identified by the tag of the functional object
that performs it.</li>

symbols, and the classes of plant item or activity for which 
a standard symbol might stand.</p>
