 <abstract>
    <p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol (AP) for the exchange
of functional data and their schematic representation for process plant.
Functional data includes the functional design of systems, and the engineering
specifications of system components to be used for subsequent procurement or
component design.</p>
    
    <p>A substantial worked example is being prepared as a User Guide.
This User Guide is based upon Annex L of ISO/CD 10303-221, and will
be available before publication of this part of ISO 10303.</p>

<p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol (AP) for
the functional design of systems within a process plant, and for 
the engineering specifications of system components to be used for
subsequent procurement or component design.</p>

<p>The principal activities that take place during the life of a
process plant, and the flows of information and material between 
them, are shown in 
<clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:F1">Figure 1</clause_ref>. 
The two activities, which are principally addressed by this 
application protocol are:</p>
<ul>
<li>conceptual design;</li>
<li>detailed design.</li>
</ul>

<figure number="1" id="F1">
<title>High level activity model</title>
<img src="high_level_activity_model.gif"/>
</figure>

<p>The schema for this part of ISO 10303 is specified by
reference to the application module that is appropriate to the conformance
class, as defined in clauses
<clause_ref linkend="conformance:cc:CC1">6.1</clause_ref>,
<clause_ref linkend="conformance:cc:CC2">6.2</clause_ref> and
<clause_ref linkend="conformance:cc:CC3">6.3</clause_ref>.
</p>

<p>Each module references further modules. The hierarchy of module dependencies
defined by these references is shown in the tree of
module dependence diagrams beginning with
<clause_ref linkend="inforeqt:data_plan:1">Figure 4</clause_ref>.</p>

<p>There is a substantial overlap in scope between this
part of ISO 10303 and 
<clause_ref linkend="bibliography:bibitem:ISO10303-227">ISO 10303-227</clause_ref>.
The overlap in scope is summarised by
<clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:F2">Figure 2</clause_ref>. 
</p>

<figure number="2" id="F2">
<title>Process plant AP coverage and overlaps</title>
<img src="ap_relationship.gif"/>
</figure>

<p>With the exception of the clauses related to schematic 
representation, the content of this part of ISO 10303 is derived from
<clause_ref linkend="bibliography:bibitem:ISO15926-2.2003">ISO 15926-2</clause_ref>.
A subset of ISO 15926-2 has been expressed
using the methodology of an ISO 10303 application protocol.</p>

<p>The subset has been chosen to support the exchange of process
plant functional data at a particular instant during the life of
a process plant. This part of ISO 10303 does not support
information about the way in which data has changed during the
life of a process plant.</p>

<p>Data defined by this part of ISO 10303 can be merged 
with other data within a life cycle data repository structured
according to ISO 15926-2. This part of 10303 is concerned with a 
single life cycle stage, which can be a single design or a record of
what exists at a single instant in time.  A repository structured 
according to ISO 15926 can hold the same data but for multiple 
versions or a design and at multiple instants in time.</p>

<p>If an ARM entity within an Application Module referenced by 
this part of ISO 10303, corresponds to an entity in
ISO 15926-2, then that correspondence is indicated by a note within
the Application Module at the end of the ARM entity definition.</p> 

<p>The ARM entities within Application Modules referenced by this part of ISO 10303, are
generic concepts such as 
  <module_ref linkend="product_as_individual:3_definition">individual product</module_ref> or
<!-- <clause_ref linkend="3_definition:individual_activity">individual activity</clause_ref>. The -->
<clause_ref linkend="definition:individual activity">individual activity</clause_ref>. The
nature of an instance of one of these entities is specified by classification by a class
within a reference data library. The reference data library within
  <clause_ref linkend="bibliography:bibitem:ISO_CD-TS15926-4">ISO 15926-4</clause_ref>
is suitable for use with this part of ISO 10303.</p>

<example number="1">'P_101' is an instance of the ARM entity
<express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_individual">Product_as_individual</express_ref>.
It can be classified by reference to the class 'pump' defined in ISO 15926-4.</example>

<example number="2">'Distill batch_27 on 2006-05-19' is an instance of the ARM entity
<express_ref linkend="individual_activity:arm:Individual_activity_arm.Individual_activity">Individual_activity</express_ref>.
It can be classified by reference to the class 'distilling' defined in ISO 15926-4.</example>

vessel, pumps, pipes and valves to small components within 
assemblies. The major equipment items will usually have unique asset 
identifiers, but the small items may not.</p>
</li>
<li><p>functional objects within a process plant;</p>
<p>These include physical objects that are defined by their role,
rather than their material realisation. Such functional objects
are usually identified by a tag rather than by an asset identifier.
These tags may be assigned at an early stage in the design process
before any material implementation exists.</p>
<p>Operational activities can be concerned only with the
functional objects. For example, the pump with tag P_101 may be
operated on Friday and again on Monday, even though the asset that
performs the role has been changed over the weekend. To support 
operational views, it is possible to record both:</p>
<ul>
<li>the functional object with its tag, which persists for long
periods during the life of the plant; and</li>
<li>the material object with its asset identifier, which is installed
to implement the functional object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This module supports the recording of classes of
physical object, and the classification of individual physical objects.
Most of the classes are equally valid for material and
functional objects within a process plant. For example, either a
functional item with a tag, or a material item with an asset
identifier can be classified as a centrifugal pump.</p>
<p>This module supports the recording of 
composition and connectivity. An individual physical object can be
broken down into interconnected sub-assemblies and 
sub-sub-assemblies as required.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Activity structure and classification</b></p>
<p>Referenced application module <module_ref linkend="activity_structure_and_classification:introduction">ISO 10303-1169</module_ref>
specifies an application module for the recording of processes
or activities carried out by people or equipment within a process plant. 
The things involved in an activity, and the role that they play can
be specified. A thing involved in an activity can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>an input or output batch of process material;</li>
<li>an equipment item that performs an activity; or</li>
<li>a person or organisation that performs an activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>This module supports the recording of classes of
activity, and the classification of individual activities. A
'role' is a class of involvement and is defined for a class of
activity.</p>
<p>This module supports the recording of 
composition and connectivity. An individual activity can be
broken down into interconnected sub-activities and 
sub-sub-activities as required. A connection between activities 
implies a flow of something between them. This can be a flow
of process material, energy or information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Property and property assignment</b></p>
<p>Referenced application module <module_ref linkend="property_and_property_assignment:introduction">ISO 10303-1198</module_ref>
specifies an application module for the recording of properties
of physical objects and activities. A property can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>something that is possessed by an individual product
or activity;</p></li>
<li><p>something that is necessarily possessed by each member of a 
class of product or activity.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Schematic and symbolization</b></p>
<p>Referenced application module <module_ref linkend="schematic_and_symbolization:introduction">ISO 10303-1203</module_ref>
specifies an application module for the recording of schematic
drawing, and for linking the symbols on a schematic drawing 
to the objects they stand for.</p>
<p>Schematics within scope include:</p>
<ul>
<li>P&amp;ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram): In a schematic
of this type, most symbols stand for physical items. Line symbols
usually stand for pipes or cables. These 
physical items can be either functional objects with tags or
material objects with asset identifiers.</li>
<li>PFD (Process Flow Diagram): In a schematic
of this type, most symbols stand for processes. Line symbols
usually stand for flows between processes. A process is 
often identified by the tag of the functional object
that performs it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This module supports the recording of libraries of standard
symbols, and the classes of product or activity for which 
a standard symbol might stand.</p>

<li>a generic concept, such centrifugal pump, pipe segment, or heat exchanger; or</li>
<li>an engineering design specification;</li>
<li>a  model of a product which can be
supplied by a manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This application module also supports classes of connection and composition relationship. A
class of relationship can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a generic concept, such as bolted flange connection, or 
assembly of impeller in centrifugal pump; or</li>
<li>a design relationship, such as the driven end bearing model for a particular
model of pump.</li>

<li><p><b>Necessary properties</b></p>
<p>The application module supports properties that are possessed by
each member of a class of product or class of activity. 
For a property of a class of product
or class of activity there may be a range of possible values.</p>

<note>This part of ISO 10303 does not support information about
the sufficient conditions for membership of a 
class of product or class of activity.</note>

        For various reasons, some entities may not be completely exported into an exchange structure. 
        There may be mandatory information in the AIM that has no correspondence in the ARM. 
        Sometimes an application may not maintain all the information that is anticipated for the data exchange. 
        Other times, the information may be maintained by a sending system but not included in the data exchange. 
        Nevertheless, the preprocessor must provide values for all mandatory attributes in an exchange file. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When no data is provided by a sending system for a string value, the
        preprocessor shall use '/NULL' or the empty string ''.
      </p>
      <p>
        To further indicate the reason why no data is provided, the following
        convention shall be used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          empty string '' indicates user data managed by the sending system
          but not provided for data exchange;
        </li>
        <li>
          string '/NULL' indicates user data in a mandatory attribute that is
          not managed by the sending system or currently not known or a mandatory AIM
          information that has no correspondence in the ARM;
        </li>
        <li>
          $ is used in the physical file, if an optional attribute is not instantiated.

   <p>
     The domain covered by this part of ISO 10303 is large and requires reference to classes
     which are defined in reference data libraries, rather than 
     modelled explicitly in the ARM. Hence:</p>
     
     <ul>
     <li>the nature of an instance of
     <express_ref linkend="individual_activity:arm:Individual_activity_arm.Individual_activity">Individual_activity</express_ref>
     is specified by reference to a

     <li>the nature of an instance of
     <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_individual">Product_as_individual</express_ref>
     is specified by reference to a
     <express_ref linkend="class_of_product:arm:Class_of_product_arm.Class_of_product">Class_of_product</express_ref>;</li>
     
     <li>the nature of an instance of
     <express_ref linkend="possession_of_property:arm:Possession_of_property_arm.Possession_of_property">Possession_of_property</express_ref>

     <p>The classification relationship between an instance and a class is made by the entity
     <express_ref linkend="classification:arm:Classification_arm.Classification">Classification</express_ref>.</p>
     
     <p>A class which corresponds to an item in a reference data library has an
     <express_ref linkend="external_item_identification_assignment:arm:External_item_identification_assignment_arm.External_item_identification">External_item_identification</express_ref>
     with attributes which identify the item. There are two approaches to the population of
     these attributes, as follows:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><p><b>identified RDL</b>;</p>
     <ul>
     <li>the <b>external_id</b> attribute is the identification of the class within the

     <li>the <b>source_type</b> attribute is the string "RDL";</li>
     <li>the <b>source_id</b> attribute is the identification of 
     the reference data library.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>If the class is defined in 
       <clause_ref linkend="bibliography:bibitem:ISO_CD-TS15926-4">ISO 15926-4</clause_ref>, then
     the <b>external_id</b> is the designation of the class within ISO 15926-4, and the

     </li>
