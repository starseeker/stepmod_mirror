	This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol for the representation of furniture catalogs 
	and data managed during the design of pieces of furniture and during the study of their inclusion in rooms.
	It satisfies an industrial need to exchange and to integrate product data with furniture decoration projects.
  </p>
		<p>A furniture catalog contains a list of pieces of furniture  to be offered to customers or distributors. A catalog provides a commercial view of the products of a furniture supplier but it does not represent the design information of the pieces of furniture. This application protocol enables to represent both kinds of information (i.e., catalog and geometry), using complementary data structures.</p>
		<p>The core of the product model is the catalog information. This information is connected to other parts of the standard to define the geometry of the pieces of furniture.</p>
		<p>
     This part of ISO 10303 provides a comprehensive capability to describe a set of furniture products specified by its variants and price list that could be chosen by retailers to offer specific 
	pieces of furniture to their customers.
   </p>
		<p>
	This part of ISO 10303 provides a comprehensive vision about furniture product data catalog exchange between furniture manufacturers and e-marketplaces or furniture retaillers or distributors.
   </p>

		<p>
     The figure shows which relevant catalog data information can be exchanged between different parties. This data can be decomposed in the following main components:
   </p>
		<ul>
			<li> the product data structure that represents simple and complex products and the product specifications that specifies their different variant combinations;</li>
			<li>expressions for rules and constraints to apply in special customized products and how these variations affect their prices;</li>
			<li>geometric representation of products;</li>
			<li> and the building room specification where furniture products can be placed.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
      A data planning model which develops these concepts is presented in
      <clause_ref linkend="fundamentals"/>
		</p>
		<p>
      This part of ISO 10303 can be used to develop standardized interfaces between software applications for furniture data product representation. These interfaces may consider catalog development and furniture decoration projects design including:
    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
        point-to-point interfaces between two systems with similar
        capability which are using different application software;  
      </li>
			<li>
        point-to-point interfaces between systems with different capability, but some common data;
      </li>
			<li>
        integrated interfaces. 
      </li>
		</ul>
		<p> 
    	This part of ISO 10303 is constructed using the ISO 10303 implementation modules and the PDM modules. It is therefore harmonized with other application protocols that use the same modules such as ISO 10303-203ed2, ISO 10303-214, ISO 10303-225 and ISO 10303-239, for product data management information.

		<p> The implementation module <module_ref linkend="catalog_data_information:introduction">ISO 1303-1351</module_ref> (Catalog data information, CC1) provides the definition for the main information data of a catalog, such as the definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a piece of furniture that the customer can choose in order to select one product from another). This part of ISO 10303 describes the structure of the product (modular pieces of furniture or just pieces of furniture that can be decomposed in its components), the effectivity of the catalog itself or the prices of the products, the documents (hardcopies or digital files) exchanged that gives additional information about the product such as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a classification of the products in order they can be found easily in a catalog depending on different search criteria. It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalog specification in the application module <module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO 1303-1103</module_ref> (Product class).</p>
		<p> The implementation module <module_ref linkend="catalog_data_information_and_shape_representation:introduction">ISO 1303-1352</module_ref> (Catalog data information and shape representation, CC2) adds to the catalog data information the capability of including the geometry of the products. It includes application modules for the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of product components, through subtypes of the generic type <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric Model</express_ref>.</p>
		<p> The implementation module <module_ref linkend="parameterized_catalog_data_information:introduction">ISO 1303-1353</module_ref> (Parameterized catalog data information, CC3) adds to the catalog data information the capability of including expressions. The application module <module_ref linkend="numerical_interface:introduction">ISO 1303-1344</module_ref> (Numerical_interface) provides all these capabilities together with the ability to specify product properties, such as the price, depending on other properties values.</p>
		<p> The implementation module <module_ref linkend="furniture_interior_decoration:introduction">ISO 1303-1354</module_ref> (Furniture interior decoration, CC4) adds the capability to create interior decoration projects. In this implementation module the definition of geometry for the products should be defined in order the products could be located in room space correctly. The piece of furniture, located in a <module_ref linkend="building_structure:introduction">Building structure</module_ref> (ISO 10303-1145), is specified by an instance of <express_ref linkend="building_item:arm:Building_item_arm.Building_element">Building element</express_ref> in the application module <module_ref linkend="building_item:introduction">ISO 1303-1144</module_ref> (Building_item).</p>
		<p> The implementation module <module_ref linkend="parameterized_catalog_data_and_shape_representation:introduction">ISO 1303-1355</module_ref> (Parameterized catalog data and shape representation, CC5) adds the capability to represent products with a great number of variants and whose composition is characterized with boolean expressions of operands selected in a set of product features and their geometry following the same approach commented in <module_ref linkend="catalog_data_information_and_shape_representation:introduction">ISO 1303-1352</module_ref> and <module_ref linkend="parameterized_catalog_data_information:introduction">ISO 1303-1353</module_ref>.</p>
		<p> The implementation module <module_ref linkend="ap236_furniture_catalog_and_interior_design:introduction">ISO 1303-1356</module_ref> (AP236 furniture catalog and interior design, CC6) merges all the

				<p>This application protocol specifies the information requirements for the exchange of catalog data.

				<b>Motivations for the usage of ISO 10303-236</b>
				<p>
Clear communication between the different parts of the supply chain is at the heart of developing any business. Information technology (IT), which is part of the communication process, is becoming a higher priority as businesses seek to reduce costs, improve design time and manage production and inventory systems. This technology is provided by ISO 10303-236. </p>
				<p>
This IT can be used with great advantage, by manufacturers, to send and receive e-commerce documents in standardised format, to get easier access to new markets, to manage product data through all product life cycle phases and distribute product catalog data to retailers and e-marketplaces. This advantages give the possibility of reducing administration costs for handling of quotations, orders, etc. as well as the opportunity to have Internet catalogs and e-commerce on manufacturers websites. However, IT systems are often viewed with some scepticism as organisations seemingly spend large amounts of time and effort trying to communicate seamlessly with little result. </p>
				<p>
A key difficulty is that every furniture company is different, with different product ranges, designs and styles. As a result businesses develop custom made systems to facilitate their development. This costs money and requires knowledge. Many smaller furniture manufacturers and retailers do not have the resources and capabilities to develop custom made systems and using external IT specialists can be very costly.</p>
				<p>
Currently industry is characterised by a diffuse range of systems, which inhibits the development of trading partnerships, the development of products, software solutions and e-commerce. These barriers are recognised as factors restricting innovation and development of the furniture industry.</p>
				<p>
Another important consideration is that the furniture industry is increasingly becoming international with retailers buying from manufacturers all over Europe and further overseas, who in turn source their raw materials from domestic and overseas suppliers. Product data standards differ across countries, so, by developing international product data standards, both national and international trade barriers will be reduced, thus resulting in an extension of the business opportunity across the supply chain.</p>
				<p>
For larger businesses the resourcing of IT systems and establishing international purchasing departments can be incorporated into the company’s business plan. But for a small business, such a prospect may appear somewhat daunting. This  consideration affects the development of the furniture industry. The process of taking part must be made easier if the industry, as a whole, is to capitalise on the benefits of international sourcing and the application of IT. The way to do this is to develop standards that aim to enable all companies to use appropriate technology effectively.</p>
				<p>
Let’s suppose we have 8 clients from 8 different countries. It should not be necessary to know 8 different languages to communicate with them. A unique common language can be used by all (for example English) to communicate. This central language, known by all, can be considered a standard of communication between the 8 clients. This is what will happen with ISO 10303–236. There will be only one language/standard that every application will understand and use to communicate with each other. If in one sector, inter-company commercial communication use sectorial standards or if generic standards are applicable, the communication is easy and direct.
				</p>
				<b>Why ISO 10303-236?</b>
				<p>
Standards are of great value to ease communication between all entities. The fact that standards allow an understanding and agreement between several entities will facilitate integration between companies and organizations. Next figure shows how the communication is eased in both directions from Manufacturer to Distributors, Retailers, Suppliers and Furniture Designers and vice versa. So what we will have is a direct communication between all this actor without the need of translating or changing information.

				</figure>
				<p>
This part of ISO 10303 is a foundation for data exchange in the furniture industry so all the software involved in manufacturing, designing and selling a product understands the same vocabulary. Thanks to this vocabulary, the manufacturer is able to share its product information with other industry partners.
Customers demand more and more information every day and this information has to be complete, updated, understandable and without errors. Standards are the answer to this problem.
This part of ISO 10303 aims to stimulate and accelerate innovation across the furniture industry. It brings together raw material suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, software houses and technology developers, from around Europe, to develop the state of the art within the industry. This involves:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>developing a classification system to use within a standard e-Business environment;</li>
					<li>creating product data standards within the furniture industry.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Impact of ISO 10303-236</b>
				<p>
The impact when adopting this standard will extend the market reach of different organisations up and down in the supply chain, thus facilitating the development of partnerships. It will also encourage product development and will instigate just-in-time business philosophy across the supply chain. Finally it will develop integrated product life cycles and the creation of partnership networks.
				</p>
				<b>Business benefits of ISO 10303-236</b>
				<p>
There are a number of business benefits companies engaging in the project can derive and these include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>developing a greater understanding of the needs of furniture manufacturers and the business issues affecting them;</li>
					<li>extending the service offered, thus developing new business streams and opening possibilities of extending the customer base across Europe;</li>
					<li>save time and money in internal communication; catalog creation and distribution; product design and administrative tasks;</li>
					<li>improve products and services reducing turn-around time; quickening the exchange of commercial information with clients regarding orders, invoices and quotes, etc.; enabling the immediate availability of information and reducing the errors in the management of catalogs and orders;</li>
					<li>apply innovative methods with minimum disruption to existing work practises.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Benefits of applying ISO 10303-236 in the furniture industry for furniture manufacturers and providers</b>
				<p>It is expected that furniture manufacturers and providers will achieve the following benefits from applying ISO 10303-236 in the furniture industry:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>reuse information;<ul>
							<li>share information between the full life cycle of furniture product development;</li>
							<li>avoid maintaining duplicate information;</li>
							<li>export information from design software to use it with ERP software;</li>
							<li>export design and graphical information from design software and allow their customers to import that information into their interior decoration software.</li>

				<p>For various reasons, some entities may not be completely exported into an exchange structure. 
			There may be mandatory information in the AIM that has no correspondence in the ARM. 
			Sometimes an application may not maintain all the information that is anticipated for the data exchange. 
			Other times, the information may be maintained by a sending system but not included in the data exchange. 
			Nevertheless, the preprocessor must provide values for all mandatory attributes in an exchange file.</p>
				<p>	When no data is provided by a sending system for a string value, the preprocessor shall use '/NULL' or the empty string ''. </p>	
			To further indicate the reason why no data is provided, the following convention shall be used:
			<ul>
					<li>Empty string '' indicates user data managed by the sending system but not provided for data exchange; </li>
					<li>String '/NULL' indicates user data in a mandatory attribute that is not managed by the sending system or currently not known or a mandatory AIM information that has no correspondence in the ARM; </li>

Readers of this part of ISO 10303 should have knowledge of the EXPRESS language, XML Schema, XML, and XML-related standards in order to understand its technical content.</p>
				<p>For the representation of data corresponding to an EXPRESS schema, ISO 10303-28 "Product data representation and exchange: Implementation methods: XML Schema governed representation of EXPRESS schema governed data" specifies the results of the generation of XML Schema type definitions and element declarations that are dependent on the EXPRESS schema. It also specifies the rules for encoding conforming data in XML to match the XML Schema and certain configuration directives.</p>
