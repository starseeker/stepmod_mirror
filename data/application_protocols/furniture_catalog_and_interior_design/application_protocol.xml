		<p>
	This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol for the representation of 
	furniture catalogs, data managed during the design of pieces of furniture, and 
	during the study of their inclusion in rooms.
	It satisfies an industrial need to exchange and to integrate product data with 
	furniture decoration projects.
	</p>
		<p>
	A furniture catalog contains a list of pieces of furniture  to be offered to customers 
	or distributors. A catalog provides a commercial view of the products of a furniture 
	supplier but it does not represent the design information of the pieces of furniture. 
	This application protocol allows representation of both kinds of information 
	(i.e. catalog and geometry), using complementary data structures.
	</p>
		<p>The core of the product model is the catalog information. This information is 
	connected to other parts of ISO 10303 to define the geometry of the pieces of furniture.
	</p>
		<p>
	This part of ISO 10303 provides a comprehensive capability to describe a set of furniture 
	products specified by its variants and price list that could be chosen by retailers to offer 
	specific pieces of furniture to their customers.
   </p>
		<p>
	It also provides a comprehensive vision about furniture product data 
	catalog exchange between furniture manufacturers and e-marketplaces or furniture 
	retailers or distributors.
   </p>
		<p>
	Some possible business cases using this part of ISO 10303 are shown in Figure 
	<clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f1">1</clause_ref>.
   </p>
		<figure id="f1" number="1">
			<title>Business cases using ISO 10303-236</title>
			<img src="figure1.gif"/>
		</figure>
		<p>
     Figure 1 shows which relevant catalog data information can be exchanged between 
     different parties. This data can be decomposed in the following main components:
   </p>
		<ul>
			<li> 
		the product data structure that represents simple and complex products and the 
		product specifications that specify their different variant combinations;
		</li>
			<li>
		expressions for rules and constraints to apply in special customized products and 
		how these variations affect their prices;
		</li>
			<li>
		geometric representation of products;
		</li>
			<li> 
		and the building room specification where furniture products can be placed.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
	A data planning model which develops these concepts is presented in
    <clause_ref linkend="fundamentals"/>
		</p>
		<p>
	This part of ISO 10303 can be used to develop standardized interfaces between 
	software applications for furniture data representation. These interfaces may 
	consider catalog development and furniture decoration projects design, including:
    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
		point-to-point interfaces between two systems with similar capabilities which use 
		different application software;
		</li>
			<li>
		point-to-point interfaces between systems with different capabilities, but some 
		common data;
		</li>
			<li>
		integrated interfaces. 
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p> 
	This part of ISO 10303 is constructed using the ISO 10303 implementation modules and 
	the PDM modules. It is therefore harmonized with other application protocols that use the 
	same modules such as ISO 10303-203, ISO 10303-214, ISO 10303-225 and ISO 10303-239, 
	for product data management information. 
    </p>

	Hyperlinks to the ISO 10303-236 implementation modules are shown below.

		<p> 
	The implementation module <module_ref linkend="catalog_data_information:introduction">ISO/TS 
	10303-1351</module_ref> provides the definition for the main information data of a catalog, 
	such as the definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features 
	of a piece of furniture that the customer can choose in order to select one product from another). 
	This part of ISO 10303 describes: the structure of the product (modular pieces of furniture or just 
	pieces of furniture that can be decomposed in its components); the effectivity of the catalog itself 
	or the prices of the products; the documents (hardcopies or digital files) exchanged that provide 
	additional information about the product, such as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings; 
	and a classification of the products so that they can be found easily in a catalog depending on 
	different search criteria. It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalog specification in 
	the application module <module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO/TS 10303-1103
	</module_ref> (Product class).
	</p>
		<p> 
	The implementation module 
	<module_ref linkend="catalog_data_information_and_shape_representation:introduction">ISO/TS 
	10303-1352</module_ref> adds to the catalog data information the capability of including the 
	geometry of the products. It includes application modules for the representation of geometric 
	models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of 
	product components, through subtypes of the generic type <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric 
	Model</express_ref>.
	</p>
		<p> 
	The implementation module 
	<module_ref linkend="parameterized_catalog_data_information:introduction">ISO/TS 
	10303-1353</module_ref> adds to the catalog data information the capability of including 
	expressions. The application module <module_ref linkend="numerical_interface:introduction">ISO/TS 
	10303-1344</module_ref> provides all these capabilities together with the ability to specify 
	product properties, such as the price, depending on other property values.
	</p>
		<p> 
	The implementation module <module_ref linkend="furniture_interior_decoration:introduction">ISO/TS 
	10303-1354</module_ref>  adds the capability to create interior decoration projects. In this 
	implementation module, the definition of geometry for the products should be defined so that 
	the products can be located in room space correctly. The piece of furniture, located in a 
	<module_ref linkend="building_structure:introduction">Building structure</module_ref> (ISO/TS 
	10303-1145), is specified by an instance of 
	<express_ref linkend="building_item:arm:Building_item_arm.Building_element">Building element
	</express_ref> in the application module <module_ref linkend="building_item:introduction">ISO/TS 
	10303-1144</module_ref>.
	</p>
		<p> 
	The implementation module 
	<module_ref linkend="parameterized_catalog_data_and_shape_representation:introduction">ISO/TS 
	10303-1355</module_ref> adds the capability to represent products with a great number of 
	variants and whose composition is characterized with boolean expressions of operands selected 
	from a set of product features and their geometry, following the same approach described in 
	<module_ref linkend="catalog_data_information_and_shape_representation:introduction">ISO/TS 
	10303-1352</module_ref> and 
	<module_ref linkend="parameterized_catalog_data_information:introduction">ISO/TS 10303-1353</module_ref>.
	</p>
		<p> 
	The implementation module 
	<module_ref linkend="ap236_furniture_catalog_and_interior_design:introduction">ISO/TS 10303-436
	</module_ref> merges all the implementation modules mentioned above.

		<p>
    Through common modules, this part of ISO 10303 is harmonized in the following areas:
    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
		with ISO 10303-214 for product structures through the PDM modules;
		</li>
			<li>
		with ISO 10303-225 for building and room space definition;
		</li>
			<li>
		with ISO 10303-203 for the representation of assembly structure, properties and 
		characterization concepts, such as date/time, approval and person-organization;
		</li>
			<li>with ISO 10303-239 for the classification and the use of reference data.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p> 
    The precise harmonization achieved can be determined from scope of the common modules. 
    Further information on the modules, and the relationship to other application protocols is provided

				<b>4.1.1 Motivations for the usage of ISO 10303-236</b>
				<p>
			Clear communication between the different parts of the supply chain is at the heart 
			of developing any business. Information technology (IT), which is part of the communication 
			process, is becoming a higher priority as businesses seek to reduce costs, improve design 
			time and manage production and inventory systems. This technology is provided by ISO 10303-236. 
			</p>
				<p>
			This IT can be used with great advantage, by manufacturers, to send and receive e-commerce 
			documents in standardised format, to get easier access to new markets, to manage product data 
			through all product life cycle phases and distribute product catalog data to retailers and 
			e-marketplaces. These advantages give the possibility of reducing administration costs for handling of 
			quotations, orders, etc. as well as the opportunity to have Internet catalogs and e-commerce on 
			manufacturers websites. However, IT systems are often viewed with some scepticism as organisations 
			seemingly spend large amounts of time and effort trying to communicate seamlessly with little result. 
			</p>
				<p>
			A key difficulty is that every furniture company is different, with different product ranges, designs and 
			styles. As a result businesses develop custom made systems to facilitate their development. This costs
			money and requires knowledge, and many smaller furniture manufacturers and retailers do not have the
			resources and capabilities to develop custom made systems. Using external IT specialists can also be 
			very costly.
			</p>
				<p>
			Currently industry is characterised by a diffuse range of systems, which inhibits the development of 
			trading partnerships, the development of products, software solutions and e-commerce. These barriers 
			are recognised as factors restricting innovation and development of the furniture industry.
			</p>
				<p>
			Another important consideration is that the furniture industry is increasingly becoming international 
			with retailers buying from manufacturers all over Europe and further overseas, who in turn source 
			their raw materials from domestic and overseas suppliers. Product data standards differ across 
			countries. This way, by developing international product data standards, both national and international trade 
			barriers will be reduced, thus resulting in an extension of the business opportunity across the supply 
			chain.
			</p>
				<p>
			For larger businesses the resourcing of IT systems and establishing international purchasing departments 
			can be incorporated into the company’s business plan. But for a small business, such a prospect may 
			appear somewhat daunting. This  consideration affects the development of the furniture industry. 
			The process of taking part must be made easier if the industry, as a whole, is to capitalise on the benefits 
			of international sourcing and the application of IT. The way to do this is to develop standards that aim to 
			enable all companies to use appropriate technology effectively.
			</p>
				<p>
			As an example, if 8 clients from 8 different countries want to comunicate, it should not be necessary for them 
			to know 8 different languages. A unique common language can be used by all (for example English) to communicate. 
			This central language, known by all, can be considered a standard of communication between the 8 clients. 
			This is what will happen with ISO 10303–236. There will be only one language/standard that every application will 
			understand and use to communicate with each other. If in one sector, inter-company commercial communication 
			use sectorial standards or if generic standards are applicable, the communication is easy and direct.
			</p>
				<b>4.1.2 Why ISO 10303-236?</b>
				<p>
			Standards are of great value to ease communication between all entities. The fact that standards allow an 
			understanding and agreement between several entities will facilitate integration between companies 
			and organizations. Next figure illustrates how the communication is eased in both directions from 
			Manufacturer to Distributors, Retailers, Suppliers and Furniture Designers and vice versa. In this sense, a 
			direct communication is established between all actors without the need of translating or modifying 
			information.
			</p>

				</figure>
				<p>
			This part of ISO 10303 is a foundation for data exchange in the furniture industry so all the software 
			involved in manufacturing, designing and selling a product understands the same vocabulary. 
			Thanks to this vocabulary, the manufacturer is able to share its product information with other industry 
			partners. Customers demand more and more information every day and this information has to be 
			complete, updated, understandable and without errors. Standards are the answer to this problem.
			This part of ISO 10303 aims to stimulate and accelerate innovation across the furniture industry. 
			It brings together raw material suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, software houses and technology

				For various reasons, some entities may not be completely exported into an exchange structure. 
				There may be mandatory information in the AIM that has no correspondence in the ARM. 
				Sometimes an application may not maintain all the information that is anticipated for the data exchange. 
				Other times, the information may be maintained by a sending system but not included in the data exchange. 
				Nevertheless, the preprocessor must provide values for all mandatory attributes in an exchange file.
				</p>
				<p>	
				When no data is provided by a sending system for a string value, the preprocessor shall use '/NULL' 
				or the empty string ''. 
				</p>	
				To further indicate the reason why no data is provided, the following convention shall be used:
				<ul>
					<li>
					Empty string '' indicates user data managed by the sending system but not provided for data exchange; 
					</li>
					<li>
					String '/NULL' indicates user data in a mandatory attribute that is not managed by the sending system 
					or currently not known or a mandatory AIM information that has no correspondence in the ARM; 
					</li>
					<li>
					$ is used in the physical file, if an optional attribute is not instantiated.
