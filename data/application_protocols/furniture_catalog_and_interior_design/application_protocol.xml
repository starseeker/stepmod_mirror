		<p>
	This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol for the representation of furniture catalogs 
	and of the data managed during the design of pieces of furniture and during the study of their inclusion in rooms.
	It satisfies an industrial need to exchange and to integrate product data with furniture decoration projects.
  </p>
		<p>
     This part of ISO 10303 provides a
     comprehensive capability to describe a set of furniture products specified by its variants and price list that could be chosen by retailers to provide specific 
	pieces of furniture to their customers.
   </p>
		<p>
     Further modules are included to support the representation
     of structured requirements.
   </p>
		<p>
	This part of ISO 10303 <!--Ruben(funStep application protocol)--> provides a comprehensive vision about furniture product data catalogs exchange 
	between furniture manufacturers and furniture retaillers/distributors.
   </p>
		<p>
			<!--RubenThe funStep-->ISO 10303-236 vision is shown in Figure 
     <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f1">1</clause_ref>.

				<!--RubenThe FunStep-->ISO 10303-236 Vision</title>
			<img src="figure1.png"/>
		</figure>
		<p>
     The vision shows how relevant information required for furniture products catalogues can be managed
     in an integrated form. This data can be decomposed in  <!--Ruben three-->the following main components:
   </p>
		<ul>
			<li> the product data structure that represents simple and complex products bill of materials (BOM); </li>
			<li> the product specifications that specifies the different variant combinations a product is allowed to have before being sold; </li>
			<!--Ruben-->
			<li>geometric representation of products;</li>
			<!--Ruben-->
			<li>expressions...;</li>
			<li> and the building room specification where furniture products could fit.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
      A data planning model which develops these concepts is presented in
      <clause_ref linkend="fundamentals"/>
		</p>
		<p>
      This part of ISO 10303 can be used to develop standardized interfaces between software applications used
      in furniture catalogue development and retaillers furniture decoration projects design.  These may include:
    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
        point-to-point interfaces between two systems with similar
        capability which are using different application software;  
      </li>
			<li>
        point-to-point interfaces between systems with different capability, but some common data;
      </li>
			<li>
        an integrated series of interfaces required to realize the PLCS vision across many
        different systems supporting a major asset. 
      </li>

		<p>A furniture catalog contains a list of references of pieces of furniture that are proposed to customers or to distributors. A catalog provides a commercial view of the products of a furniture supplier but it does not represent the design information of the pieces of furniture. This application protocol enables to represent both kinds of information, using distinct data structures.</p>
		<p>It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.</p>
		<p>The core of the product model is catalog information. This information is connected to other parts in order to define the geometry of the pieces of furniture, to deal with boolean expressions of operands, to select a set of product features and to define a simple decoration project.</p>
		<p> The application module <module_ref linkend="catalog_data_information:introduction">ISO 1303-1351</module_ref> (Catalog data information) provides the definition for the main information data of a catalog, such as the definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a piece of furniture that the customer can chose in order to select one product from another. The structure of the product (modular pieces of furniture or just pieces of furniture that can be decomposed in its components), the effectivity of the catalog itself or the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) that gives additional information about the product such as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a classification of the products in order they could be found easily in a catalog depending on different search criteria; the properties of the product (not selectable by the user). It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalog specification in the <module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO 1303-1103</module_ref> (Product class).</p>
		<p> The application module <module_ref linkend="catalog_data_information_and_shape_representation:introduction">ISO 1303-1352</module_ref> (Catalog data information and shape representation) adds to the catalog data information the capability of including the geometry of the products.

		<p> The application module <module_ref linkend="parameterized_catalog_data_information:introduction">ISO 1303-1353</module_ref> (Parameterized catalog data information) adds to the catalog data information the capability of including boolean expressions of operands selected in a set of product features.

    	This part of ISO 10303 is constructed using the ISO 10303 application modules. It is therefore harmonized
    	with other application protocols that use the same modules.  This part of ISO 10303 uses the application modules
    	which were developed to achieve harmonization between application
    	protocols ISO 10303-203, ISO 10303-214, ISO 10303-233 and ISO 10303-239, 
    	for product data management information (the "PDM Modules"). 
    </p>
		<p>
    Through common modules, this part of ISO 10303 is harmonized in the
    following areas:
  </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
      with part ISO 10303-214 for product structures through the PDM modules;
    </li>
			<li>
      with part ISO 10303-203 Edition 2 for the representation of assembly structure, properties and characterization 
      concepts such as date/time, approval and person-organization;
    </li>
			<li>
      with parts ISO-10303-239 for the classification and the use of reference data. 
    </li>
		</ul>
		<!--Ruben
		<p>
    The requirements management capability in this part of ISO 10303 was
    developed jointly with the project developing 
    a new application protocol for System Engineering under the new workm item project ISO 10303-233.    
  </p>
-->
		<p> 
  The precise harmonization achieved can be determined from scope of the common modules. Further information on the
  modules, and the relationship to other application protocols is provided
