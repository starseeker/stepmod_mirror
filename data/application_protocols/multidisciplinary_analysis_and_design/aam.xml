  <!-- view point of the IDEF0 model -->
  <viewpoint>of the analyst who is responsible for performing a
structural analysis of a composite structural part product. The analyst may transfer shape (geometric and
topological), and material (composite and metallic) constituent and representation information from the
design function to aid in the creation of analysis models, and may transfer this information back to the
design function to provide recommended changes</viewpoint>
