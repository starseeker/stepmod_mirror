   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol for the
     representation of product life cycle support (PLCS).  It satisfies an
     industrial need to exchange and to integrate 
     product support information.
   </p>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 provides a
     comprehensive capability to describe a set of products needing support and
     the work required to sustain such products in an operational condition. It also provides a
     capability to record, and assemble over time, a history of:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li> work done and resource used;</li>
     <li> product usage;</li>
     <li> product location, states and properties;</li>
     <li> resource location, states and properties.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
     Further modules are included to support the representation
     of structured requirements.
   </p>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 enables the creation and management through time of a set of
     Assured Product and Support Information (APSI) which can be used to
     specify and control required support activities throughout a product's
     life, including a description of the resources needed to provide support.  This information is assumed
     to be subject to configuration change
     management, applied to sustain the validity as changes occur through life. 
   </p>
   <p>
     The PLCS vision is shown in Figure
     <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f1">1</clause_ref>.
   </p>
   <figure id="f1" number="1">
     <title>The PLCS vision</title>
     <img src="figure1.png"/>
   </figure>

   <p>
     The vision shows how relevant information required for life cycle support can be managed
     in an integrated form.  This life cycle data has two components: 
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       the APSI, which defines the product and
       its support, and is subject to configuration change management; 
     </li>
      <li>
        and related information, including feedback on the history of the product, activities and resources.
	 Related information may be updated or corrected with time, but is not subject to configuration change management.
      </li>      
    </ul>

    <p>
      Relevant applications will enable maintainers and other support staff to query this life cycle data as needed.
      The response to such a query could include task instructions tailored to the individual product, location
      and activity. If so required, this part of ISO 10303 could also store a copy of the query response.
      Structured data from the query and response is then available to populate large sections of the feedback 
      report, typically required on completion of maintenance activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      APSI can also be used by work planning applications. This may include generating a list of resources needed 
      at a particular location, for a given period, to support planned activities.  Structured information from 
      such a plan could be used to populate transaction messages within an
      Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) , or similar, system used to operate 
      a supply chain.  Information from supply chain transactions could be extracted to 
      update aspects of the life cycle data, such as current resource locations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This part of ISO 10303 can be used to develop standardized interfaces between software applications used
      in life cycle support.  These may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        point-to-point interfaces between two systems with similar
        capability which are using different application software;  
      </li>
      <li>
        point-to-point interfaces between systems with different capability, but some common data;
      </li>
      <li>
        an integrated series of interfaces required to realize the PLCS vision across many
        different systems supporting a major asset. 
      </li>
    </ul>      
    <p>
      This part of ISO 10303 was developed to represent the data associated with major
      engineering assets, such as aircraft, ships or weapon systems, which may
      exist as a product design or as realized products. It can also be applied to
      much simpler products such a pump or an amplifier. The industry focus of this part of ISO 10303
      is shown by the shaded area in Figure
      <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f2">2</clause_ref> which is
      characterized by complex products, with long lives and  
      demanding support requirements. 
    </p>
    <figure id="f2" number="2">
      <title>Market segmentation</title>
      <img src="figure2.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
    The benefits from using this part of ISO 10303 to organise product support information
   rise as the product, or the support arrangements, are subject to more
      frequent change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major information concepts in this part of ISO 10303 are illustrated by Figure  
      <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f3">3</clause_ref>.
    </p>
    <figure id="f3" number="3">
      <title>PLCS Concepts</title>
      <img src="figure3.png"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The three central concepts in this part of ISO 10303 are product, activity and resource.  Each of these may be associated with properties, states
      or locations. Conditions may be applied to relationships between
      these concepts. Many entities, attributes and relationships  
      within this part of ISO 10303 can also be qualified by applying:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        classification, including an option to use class definitions stored in external class libraries as reference data;
      </li>
      <li>
        characterization, which enables information to be held as to who defined a particular value, under what circumstance;
      </li>
      <li>
        justification, which enables information justifying a value or relationship to be recorded. Justifications may themselves be
        classified and characterized.        
      </li>
    </ul> 

    <p>
      A data planning model which develops these concepts is presented in
      <clause_ref linkend="fundamentals"/>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The upper parts of the module hierarchy for this part of ISO 10303 is shown in Figure

    </p>
    <note>
      Only the main modules are shown in Figure
      <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f4">4</clause_ref>.
     The remaining modules have been excluded to reduce the complexity of the diagram.

    <p>
      This part of ISO 10303 is constructed using the ISO 10303 application
      modules. It is therefore harmonized with other application protocols
      that use the same modules. 
      Furthermore, this part of ISO 10303 uses the set of application modules
      for product data management information (the "PDM Modules"). These are
      based on the "PDM Schema" <a href="http://www.pdm-if.org/pdm_schema/"/> that was developed to achieve
      harmonization between application protocols ISO 10303-203, ISO
      10303-214 and ISO 10303-232.
    </p>

  <p>
    Through common modules, this part of ISO 10303 is harmonized in the
    following areas:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      with part ISO 10303-214 for the domain of conformance class 6;
    </li>
    <li>
      with part ISO 10303-203 Edition 2 for the representation of assembly structure, properties and characterization 
      concepts such as date/time, approval and person-organization;
    </li>
    <li>
      with parts ISO-10303-221, ISO 10303-236 and ISO-15926 in the approach
      to classification and the use of reference data. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The requirements management capability in this part of ISO 10303 was
    developed jointly with the project developing 
    a new application protocol for Systems Engineering under the new work item project ISO 10303-233.    
    Systems Engineering and product support analysis are related disciplines used for complex products.
    This part of ISO 10303 and ISO 10303-233 use common modules, including for text-based requirements and for product and system breakdowns, 
    to enable data to be shared across both disciplines.
    
  </p>
  <p> 
  The precise harmonization achieved can be determined from scope of the common modules. Further information on the
  modules, and the relationship to other application protocols is provided
  in <clause_ref linkend="fundamentals"/>.

     <description>             
      <p> 
      This part of ISO 10303 enables the representation of information required to manage life cycle support for
      a set of complex operational products, such as ships, aircraft or radar
      systems.  The items to be supported  
      are known collectively as the product in focus or PIF.  Specification of the required support is
      achieved by a support solution definition. This includes the information typically published in 
      maintenance manuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      The products within the PIF may require several support solution
      definitions, each applicable to a  
      different sub-group of products, such as those operated by a specific customer. Different support 
      solution definitions may also be needed to address different operating environments, or the
      availability of different support facilities.  The context for the development of each support solution
      definition is called a deployment environment.

      (AP239 Task specification resourced)
      provides a capability to hold the support solution definition for a
      group of operational products  
      within the context a specific deployment environment. It uses four
      key concepts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>product;</li>
      <li>activity;</li>
      <li>resource;</li>
      <li>condition.</li>       
    </ul>
    <p>
      Activity and resource information within this module can be intimately related to product definition
      information down to the level of individual operational products.
    </p>

    <p> 
    Product description capability in this part of ISO-10303 is provided by
    the application module 
    <module_ref
      linkend="Ap239_product_definition_information:introduction">
      ISO 10303-1292</module_ref> (AP239 product definition information). 
  This large module extends the configuration management capability provided by ISO 10303-203 
  and ISO 10303-214 to include information about individual realized products as they change
  through time and use. This is achieved by the module 
  <module_ref linkend="product_as_individual:introduction">ISO 10303-1164</module_ref> 
  (product as individual).
</p>
  <p> 
  Product definition information in this part of ISO 10303 is defined using
  the application module
  <module_ref linkend="assembly_structure:introduction">ISO 10303-1026</module_ref>
  (assembly structure)
  in a similar manner to that used by parts ISO 10303-203 and ISO 10303-214.
  Additional capability is provided by the application module
  <module_ref linkend="Product_breakdown:introduction">ISO 10303-1248</module_ref>
  (Product breakdown) which can represent the many
  different decompositional views of a product required by life cycle participants.
  A system breakdown (defined using the application module
  <module_ref linkend="system_breakdown:introduction">ISO 10303-1214</module_ref>)
  is provided to act as a collector of requirements for system
  elements, which may exist, and have relevance to support planning, before
  any design is developed. Elements in a system breakdown may 
  be realized by physical items, or by functions,  or in other ways, such
  as by the creation of a new organization.
  </p>

  <p>
    A physical breakdown (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="physical_breakdown:introduction">ISO 10303-1215</module_ref>)
    provides a means to view a product as a collection of
    physical elements, which may not correspond to part designs.
    
    A functional breakdown (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="functional_breakdown:introduction">ISO 10303-1216</module_ref>)
    provides a means to view the product functions and
    may be used to identify the functions that require support activity. 

    A zonal breakdown (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="zonal_breakdown:introduction">ISO 10303-1217</module_ref>)
    is provided to enable decomposition of an item into zones.  

    Elements within a hybrid breakdown (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:introduction">ISO 10303-1218</module_ref>)
    may be of any type.

    A breakdown may apply to a product design or to an individual
    product. Breakdowns can be related to other breakdowns 
    and to the assembly structure
    (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="Assembly_structure:introduction">ISO 10303-1026</module_ref>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The application module
    <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction">
      ISO 10303-1251</module_ref>
    is also provided to identify and describe any interface
    between products.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application module 
    <module_ref linkend="Ap239_document_management:introduction">ISO 10303-1297</module_ref>
    provides a capability to describe any type of document. It includes
    modules to describe a message (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="message:introduction">ISO 10303-1270</module_ref>),
    an envelope (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="envelope:introduction">ISO 10303-1265</module_ref>)
    and information rights (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="information_rights:introduction">ISO 10303-1241</module_ref>)
    such as intellectual property rights, privacy restrictions or copyright.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The concept of activity (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="Activity:introduction">ISO 10303-1047</module_ref>, Activity)
    is of critical importance to support engineers and 
    hence to this part of ISO 10303.  It can be used to define work by people and organization, 
    the usage of a product, support opportunities such as a planned re-fit
    of a ship (a future planned activity) or a product operating scenario. 
    
    The application module 
    <module_ref linkend="Activity_as_realized:introduction">ISO 10303-1259</module_ref>
    (Activity as realized)
    is provided
    to distinguish between a planned activity, and one that has already
    taken place, or at has at least started. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maintenance manuals describe how to perform potentially necessary tasks.
    In this part of ISO-10303 tasks are defined by 
    <module_ref linkend="task_specification:introduction">ISO 10303-1262</module_ref> 
    (Task specification). 
    This module can define tasks as text, with warnings, safety notes and other specific forms of content.
    It can also define tasks as a series of logically  related task steps, thus providing computer sensible task 
    instructions, for display on a screen, or for execution by diagnostic or
    repair tools. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The resources required to perform a task may be specified and quantified
    either as a required resource
    (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="required_resource:introduction">ISO 10303-1267</module_ref>, Required resource)
    or as a  resource item
    (defined using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="resource_item:introduction">ISO 10303-1268</module_ref>, Resource item).
  </p>

  <p>
    Required resources may be described by a structured requirement
    statement using the application module 
    <module_ref linkend="requirement_management:introduction">ISO 10303-1348</module_ref>
    (Requirement management).
    This application module may also be used to define requirements for
    products or services. This part of ISO-10303 
    thus provides a capability to maintain the important chain of relationships from a customer requirement,
    to a system breakdown element, into a function and then a product version, from which is realized an
    operational product that meets the customers' need.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the support domain people and organizations may be identified as resource items. Capability
    has therefore been provided to describe people and organizations both
    as individuals, via the application module 
    <module_ref linkend="person_organization:introduction">ISO 10303-1011</module_ref> 
    (Person organization) and as types, using the application module
    <module_ref linkend="type_of_person:introduction">ISO 10303-1245</module_ref>
    (Type of person)
    or by defining a class of organization. 
    
    It is also possible to describe a position in an organization by using
    the application module
    <module_ref linkend="position_in_organization:introduction">ISO 10303-1242</module_ref>
    (Position in organization),
    and to assign qualifications and experience
    (defined using application modules
    <module_ref linkend="qualifications:introduction">ISO 10303-1244</module_ref> - Qualifications
    and 
    <module_ref linkend="experience:introduction">ISO 10303-1243</module_ref> - Experience
    respectively).
  </p>

  <p>
    The application module
    <module_ref linkend="condition:introduction">ISO 10303-1253</module_ref> (Condition)
    is used primarily to hold the conditions under which a task
    falls due.  Conditions may be expressed in terms of condition parameters, using properties, states, locations
    or other relevant entities. The completion of one activity may be used as
    the condition for another.
  </p>

  <p>
    The capability to represent properties in this part of ISO 10303 is similar to that provided in 
    ISO 10303-203 and ISO 10303-214, but has been extended to address the ambiguity in property values
    typically encountered in the support domain. This is achieved using the module
    <module_ref linkend="extended_measure_representation:introduction">ISO 10303-1106</module_ref>
    (Extended measure representation).

    Capability is also provided
    to describe product faults, and other states of interest, by using the
    application module
    <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction">ISO 10303-1255</module_ref>
    (State definition).

    States may also be defined for activities
    and resources. Information on the actual state of a product, activity
    or resource can be held as observed states as defined in application module    
    <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction">ISO 10303-1256</module_ref>
    (State observed).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The application module
    <module_ref linkend="location:introduction">ISO 10303-1276</module_ref>
    (Location)
    enables the description of different types of location typically
    encountered during product support. It does not address location as a
    point within a product geometry. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The  work management capabilities in this part of ISO 10303 are
    completed by four other modules that extend 
    <module_ref

        ISO 10303-1287</module_ref>
      (AP239 activity recording)
      enables similar information to be held about completed
      activities. This module, and the one above, are provided to enable
      feedback, collected from observations of the real world, to be captured 
      and related to planned activities and product designs.  Both use the
      application module 
      <module_ref linkend="observation:introduction">ISO 10303-1258</module_ref>
      (Observations)
      to record data not covered by explicit entities. 
      All feedback can be characterized to provide relevant context;
    </li> 

    <li>
      <module_ref linkend="Ap239_product_life_cycle_support:introduction">ISO 10303-439</module_ref>
      (AP239 product life cycle support)
      - the AP Module - enables a product status record
      to be linked to the activity which reported it, but otherwise is used
      simply to establish a single point of convergence for 
      the modules in this application protocol.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The final component in the data planning model 
    <clause_ref linkend="inforeqt:data_plan:1"/>
    is 
    <module_ref
      linkend="Ap239_management_resource_information:introduction">ISO 10303-1289</module_ref>
    (AP239 management resource information).
    This provides a collection
    of basic concepts which can be applied to most other entities within
    this part of ISO 10303 to record who provided or authorised 
    any particular value at any point in time.  </p>
<p>
This module also enables the
    definition and assignment of a class,
    defined by applying the application modules
    <module_ref linkend="class:introduction">ISO 10303-1070</module_ref>
    (Class) or 
    <module_ref linkend="class:introduction">ISO 10303-1246</module_ref>
    (Attribute classification)
    to appropriate entities or attributes. The application module 
    <module_ref linkend="external_class:introduction">ISO 10303-1275</module_ref>
    (External class)
    enables reference to be made to class definitions held in an external
    class library as reference data. 
    This can be used to extend and to tailor AP239 to suit different
    business environments but applications which use different  
    reference data will not be able to exchange data until the class definitions are harmonized.

     <p>
       Usage guidance for this part of ISO 10303 is being developed by the 
       Product Life Cycle Support (PLCS) Technical Committee of the OASIS 
       (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
       Standard) organization <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org"/>.
     </p>
   </annex_clause>
 </usage_guide> 

 <tech_disc>
   <annex_clause title="Introduction">
     <p>
       This annex provides guidance on the intended use of the Application
       Reference Model provided in this part of ISO 10303.
       The Application
       Reference Model is defined in Clause
       <module_ref linkend="ap239_product_life_cycle_support:4_interfaces">4</module_ref>
       of the AP module (ISO 10303-439). 
     </p>
   </annex_clause>


   <annex_clause title="Overall approach">
     <p>
       Product life cycle support implies holding information about products through their life. 
       This leads to the need to manage change of that information over time. 
       This has the following modelling consequences when compared to
supporting the exchange of data sets that reflect a short period in time.
     </p>
       <ol>
         <li>
           Use of explicit attributes of an entity, such as x.id where x is an entity data type and id is an identifier, is discouraged. 
	   For the example of x.id, assigning an identifier to x by means of an assignment entity is preferred as this allows for different identifiers over time 
	   to be recorded; 
         </li>
         <li>
		 Allowance has to be made for holding multiple values of properties that have been used or apply over different time periods, such as where a new value is available based on experience 
		 rather than estimation. Not only is it necessary to be able to hold more than one value, for example, for a given property, it then becomes necessary to associate other data 
		 with these values, such as recording who provided the values and when. Where an entity has a value associated by an explicit attribute this is not possible;
         </li>
         <li>
           The set of requirements for the model are not completely known and new requirements will arise during the period of its use 
	   and during the life time of a product for which the model is being used.
           Therefore many of the modules used allow for classification of entities, where such classification 
           is used to augment the definitions provided in this part of ISO 10303 and the parts of ISO 10303 referenced by it.
         </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
	       Specific cases of these consequences are described in the following clauses. 
	       The final clause deals with the possibilities for implementing this part of ISO 10303.
     </p>
   </annex_clause>
   
   <annex_clause title="Use of classification">
	<!--           <p>
		Describe in relation to Product category
       See NO-23.
     </p>
     -->
	   <p>
	     The domain covered by  this part of ISO 10303 is large and includes many specific requirements that have not been explicitly modelled in the ARM. 
	     Instead of providing explicit subtypes for many of the entities, the entity has been made a target for 
	     <express_ref linkend="classification_assignment:arm:Classification_assignment_arm.Classification_assignment"/>. 
	     Thus one or more classes can be associated with any instance of the entity concerned. 
	     See the <module_ref linkend="class:introduction"/> and <module_ref linkend="external_class:introduction"/> modules. 
	     These classes refine or augment the meaning of the entity. 
     </p>
     <p>
	     For example, there are many different types of properties associated with components that are relevant to product life cycle support. 
	     The ARM allows the properties that can be associated with parts to be classified. Such classification is then used to specify the specific type of property.
	     Any set of specific property types, such as mean time to failure, that could have been provided by explicit modelling in the ARM, is likely to be incomplete. 
	     Furthermore, as business practices change, different properties are likely to be required over time and these can be introduced by means of a new class.  
     </p>
     <p>
       Similarly, if it is required to make an assertion about something, this can be achieved by classification.
       For example, a 
       <express_ref linkend="task_specification:arm:Task_specification_arm.Task_method"/>
       that involves risk to the persons who carry out the method can be asserted to be safety critical by means of classification.
     </p>
     <p>
	     This approach relies on the use of a common set of classes between partners in a data exchange, together with a shared understanding of what each class means. 
	     It is anticipated that classes will be held in a shared class library.
     </p>
     <p>
		<express_ref linkend="classification_assignment:arm:Classification_assignment_arm.Classification_assignment"/> provides the principal mechanism for associating classes with items. 
		However, an additional mechanism is provided for products, that is <express_ref linkend="product_categorization:arm:Product_categorization_arm.Product_category"/>. 
		See the <module_ref linkend="product_categorization:introduction"/> and <module_ref linkend="product_identification:introduction"/> modules. 
		Product_category is used to distinguish between the different subtypes of <express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> 
		defined in this part of ISO 10303. 
		Examples are: <express_ref linkend="part_and_version_identification:arm:Part_and_version_identification_arm.Part"/>,
		<express_ref linkend="requirement_identification_and_version:arm:Requirement_identification_and_version_arm.Requirement"/> and 
		<express_ref linkend="document_and_version_identification:arm:Document_and_version_identification_arm.Document"/>. This approach is used by other ISO 10303 Application Protocol parts. 
		More specific types of products, such as Oil filter as a type of 
		<express_ref linkend="part_and_version_identification:arm:Part_and_version_identification_arm.Part"/> should be specified by means of 
		<express_ref linkend="classification_assignment:arm:Classification_assignment_arm.Classification_assignment"/>, thus allowing the use of a class library via 
		<express_ref linkend="external_class:arm:External_class_arm.External_class"/>.
     </p>
     <p>
	     <module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> is made available where it is appropriate to allow classification of an attribute of an entity instance.
	     In a similar fashion to 
	     <express_ref linkend="classification_assignment:arm:Classification_assignment_arm.Classification_assignment"/>, this can be used to refine or augment the meaning of the attribute.
     </p>
   </annex_clause>
   
   
   <annex_clause title="General use of assignment entities">
     <p>
	     The ARM of this part of ISO 10303 defines a set of assignment entities. Examples include: 
     </p>
     <ol>
       <li><express_ref linkend="work_request:arm:Work_request_arm.Activity_method_assignment"/>;</li>
       <li><express_ref linkend="activity:arm:Activity_arm.Applied_activity_assignment"/>;</li> 
       <li><express_ref linkend="state_observed:arm:State_observed_arm.Applied_state_assignment"/>;</li>
       <li><express_ref linkend="state_definition:arm:State_definition_arm.Applied_state_definition_assignment"/>;</li>
       <li><express_ref linkend="selected_item:arm:Selected_item_arm.Selected_item_assignment"/>.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>
	     Such entities have a role attribute that can be used to define the specific meaning of each assignment. 
	     Where such assignment entities have a role attribute of type STRING and the entity is also included in the classification_item select, 
	     classification is the preferred means by which to assert the meaning of the assignment. 
	     The role attribute is then instanced with the value set either to be an empty (zero-length) string or to be "\IGNORE". 
	     The use of "\IGNORE" is recommended.
     </p>
   </annex_clause>
   
   
   <annex_clause title="Use of identification assignment">
     <p>
       For historical reasons, the ARM specified in this part of ISO 10303
       contains multiple identifier attributes, typically modelled as x.id where x
       is the entity name.  
       This implies that there is only one identifier for the entity and
       either it does not change or the model does not allow for any means of
       recording change except by over-writing the  
       value. 
     </p>
     <p>
       In practice, identifiers can change over time and also there may be more than one identifier that applies to something. 
       The latter case typically arises where organizations assign their own identifiers to things. 
       A consequence of this is that an identifier as a string of characters is not useful without knowing more. 
       At a minimum it is necessary to know which organization is responsible for the identifier.
     </p>
     <p>
       It is recommended that all requirements for identifiers are met using the basic structure shown in Figure
       <clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:fh1">I.1</clause_ref>. 
     </p>
     <p> 
     Note that both
       <express_ref
         linkend="person_organization_assignment:arm:Person_organization_assignment_arm.Organization_or_person_in_organization_assignment"/>
       and 
       <express_ref linkend="identification_assignment:arm:Identification_assignment_arm.Identification_assignment"/> 
       have role attributes that have been given as empty strings. 
       The respective roles are 'Id_owner' and, given that the thing being identified in the example is a Part, 'Part_type_code'. 
       These are specified by using
       <express_ref linkend="classification_assignment:arm:Classification_assignment_arm.Classification_assignment"/>.
     </p>
     <p>
       A number of entities have a name attribute in addition to the id
       attribute. Where this is being used to assign a name, then the name
       should be treated as an identifier and assigned using
       <express_ref
         linkend="identification_assignment:arm:Identification_assignment_arm.Identification_assignment"/>
       using the using the same basic structure shown in Figure
       <clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:fh1">I.1</clause_ref>.

   <annex_clause title="Use of Name assignment">
     <p>
       The <module_ref linkend="name_assignment:introduction"/>
     module provides a means to associate further identifiers that are

	     Where <express_ref linkend="observation:arm:Observation_arm.Observation"/> should be used is for those cases that are not covered by explicit capabilities provided by the ARM.

	     is inadequate or unclear, an <express_ref linkend="observation:arm:Observation_arm.Observation"/> can be used to describe the problem.
