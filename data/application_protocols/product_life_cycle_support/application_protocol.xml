     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol for the
     representation of product life cycle support (PLCS).  It provides a
     comprehensive capability to describe a set of products needing support and
     the work required to sustain such products in an operational condition. 
   </p>
   <p>AP239 enables the creation and management through time of an
     Assured set of Product and Support Information (APSI) which can be used to
     specify and control required support activities throughout a product's
     life.  This information is assumed to be subject to configuration change
     management, applied to sustain the information needed to support the product, in line
     with the changing product, over its full life cycle. 
   </p>

   <p>
     Capability is also provided to describe the resources required,
     provided and used to deliver support, and to record the history of the
     product usage, state and work done.  AP239 also includes modules to support the
     representation of structured requirements. (CAN WE MAKE SOME
     ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO AP233 HERE?
   </p>
   <p>
       The PLCS vision is shown in Figure
       <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f1">1</clause_ref>.
     </p>
   <figure id="f1" number="1">
     <title>The PLCS Vision</title>
     <img src="figure1.png"/>
   </figure>

<p> The vision shows how relevant information required for life cycle support can be collected
into an integrated form.  This life cycle data has two components: 
<ul>
      <li>
      the APSI, which defines the product and
its support, and is subject to Configuration Change Management; </li>
      <li>and Related Information, including feedback on the history of the product, activities and resoucres, which 
may be superceded, but is not usually subject to Configuration Management.
      </li>
      
</ul>
<p>
Relevant applications will enable maintainers and other support staff to query this life cycle data as needed.
  The response could include instructions tailored to the individual product, location
and activities. If required for assurance purposes, AP239 could also hold a copy of the query response.
 This data could also be used to populate aspects of any feedback report required on completion of an activity.
 APSI can also be used by work planning applications. This may include generating a list of resources needed 
at a particular location, for a given period, to support planned activities.  Structured information from 
such a plan could be used to populate transaction messages within an ERP, or similar, system used to operate
 a supply chain.  Information from supply chain transactions could be extracted to 
update aspects the life cycle data, such as current resource locations. </p>
   
   <p>
     AP239 was developed to represent the data associated with complex
     engineering assets, such as aircraft, ships or weapon systems, which may
     exist either as a product design, or as realized products. It can also be applied to
     much simpler products such a pump or an amplifier. The range of target
     products is shown by Figure
     <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f2">2</clause_ref>.
     <figure id="f2" number="2">
      <title>Market segmentation</title>
      <img src="figure2.png"/>
    </figure>
  </p>
  <p>
    The main industry focus for AP239 is shown by the shaded area. This
    is characterized by complex, high value products with long life cycles
    and demanding in-service support requirements.  The benefits from using AP239 to organise support information
    rise when the product, or the support arrangements, are subject to frequent change.</p>
<p>

      The major information concepts in AP239 are illustrated by Figure  
       <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:f3">3</clause_ref>.
   </p>
    <figure id="f3" number="3">
      <title>PLCS Concepts</title>
      <img src="figure3.png"/>
    </figure>


 	<p>The three main concepts are product, activity and resource.  Each may be associated with properties, states
 or locations. Conditions may be applied to relationships between these concepts. Many entites, attributes and relationships 
within AP239 can also be qualified by applying:
<ul>
      <li>
       Classification, including an option to use reference data providing class definitions in external class libraries;
      </li>
      <li>
Characterization, which enables information to be held as to who defined a particular value, under what circumstance;
      </li>
      <li>
Justification, which enables information justifying a value or relationship to be recorded. Justifications may themselves be
classified and characterized.
       
      </li>
    </ul> 
 A data planning model which develops these concepts is presented in Section 4.1  </p>

    <p>

      <p>The module 
      <module_ref
        linkend="Ap239_task_specification_resourced:introduction">Ap239 Task specification resourced</module_ref>
 which lies at the heart of PLCS,  provides a capability to hold the substantial volume of information typically found 
in maintenance manuals for complex operational products such as a ships, aircraft or radar systems. It uses four key concepts:
      <ul>
         <li>product;</li>
	<li>activity;</li>
        <li>resource;</li>
        <li>condition.</li>
       
      </ul>

      Using this module, activity and resource information can be intimately related to the configuration of individual
 operational products.</p>

<p> Product description capability in AP239 is provided by 
<module_ref linkend="Ap239_product_definition_information:introduction"></module_ref>. 
 This large module extends the Configuration Management capability provide by AP203 and AP214 to include information 
about real, individual products as they change through time and use. This is achieved by the module 
<module_ref linkend="product_as_realized:introduction"/>. 
</p>
<p> Product configuration in AP239 is defined using  <module_ref linkend="assembly_structure:introduction"/> in 
a similar manner to that used by the above APs.
Additional capability is provided by the <module_ref linkend="Product_breakdown:introduction"/> module which
can describe the many
 different decompositional views of a product required by life cycle participants.
 A <module_ref linkend="system_breakdown:introduction"/> is provided to act as a collector of requirements for system
 elements, which may exist, and have relevance to support planning, before  any design is developed. Elements in a system breakdown may
be realized by physical items, or by functions,  or in other ways, such as by the creation of a new organization.</p>
<p>
 <module_ref linkend="physical_breakdown:introduction"/>  provides a means to view a product as a collection of
physical elements, which may not correspond to part designs.
 <module_ref linkend="functional_breakdown:introduction"/> provides a means to view the product functions, and
may be used to identify the functions that require support activity. A <module_ref linkend="zonal_breakdown:introduction"/> is provided to enable decomposition
of an item into zones.  Elements within a <module_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:introduction"/> many be of any type.
A breakdown may apply to a product design or to an indiviudal product. Breakdowns can be related to other breakdowns
and to the  <module_ref linkend="Assembly_structure:introduction"/>. </p>

<p> A capability is also provided to identify and describe any <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction"/> 
between products.</p>

<p> The module <module_ref linkend="Ap239_document_management:introduction"/> provides capability
 to describe any type of document.  It includes modules to describe a <module_ref linkend="message:introduction"/>, 
an <module_ref linkend="envelope:introduction"/> and <module_ref linkend="information_rights:introduction"/> 
such as intellectual property rights, privacy restrictions or copyright. </p>

<p>  The concept of <module_ref linkend="Activity:introduction"/> is of critical importance to support engineers and 
hence to AP239.  It can be used to define work by people and organization, 
the usage of a product, support opportunities such as a planned refit of a ship (a future planned activity) and 
product operating scenarios. The module <module_ref linkend="Activity_as_realized:introduction"/>  is provided
 to distinguish between a planned activity, and one that has already taken place, or at has at least started. </p>
<p>
Maintenance manuals describe how to perform potentially necessary tasks.
In AP239 this is accomplished by <module_ref linkend="task_specification:introduction"/>. This module can define
 tasks as text, with warnings, safety notes and other specific forms of content. It can also define tasks
 as a series of logically  related thus providing computer sensible task instructions, for display on a screen, 
or for execution by diagnostic or repair tools.
 </p>

<p> The resources required to perform a task may be specified and quantified either as a
<module_ref linkend="required_resource:introduction"/> or as a  <module_ref linkend="resource_item:introduction"/>. </p>
<p>
Required resources may be described by a structured requirement statement using the module 
<module_ref linkend="requirement_management:introduction"/>. 
This module may also be used to define requirements for products or services. AP239 thus provides a capability
 to maintain the important chain of relationships from a customer requirement, to a system breakdown element,
 into a function and then a product version, which may be realized by one more individual products 
to meet the customers' need.  </p>

<p>In the support domain people and organizations may be identified as resource items. Capability
has therefore been provided to describe people and organizations both as individuals, via the module 
<module_ref linkend="person_organization:introduction"/> and as types, using
<module_ref linkend="type_of_person:introduction"/> or by defining a class of organization. 
It is also possible to describe a <module_ref linkend="position_in_organization:introduction"/>, and a
 <module_ref linkend="person_organization_assignment:introduction"/> and to assign 
 <module_ref linkend="qualifications:introduction"/> and <module_ref linkend="experience:introduction"/>.</p>

<p>The <module_ref linkend="condition:introduction"/> module is used primarily to hold the conditions under which a task
 falls due.  Conditions may be expressed in terms of condition parameters, using relevant properties, states, locations
 or other entities. The completion of one activity may be used as the condition for another.   </p>

<p> The capability to represent properties in AP239 is similar to that provided in AP203 and AP214, but has been extended
 to address the ambiguity in property values typically encountered in the support domain through the module
 <module_ref linkend="extended_measure_representation:introduction"/>.  Capability is provided to describe product faults,
 and other states of interest, by <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/>.
  States can also be defined for activities
 and resources. Information on the actual state of a product, activity or resource can be held as a 
<module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/>.  </p>

<p> The <module_ref linkend="location:introduction"/> module enables the description of different types of location typically
encountered during product support. It does not address location as a point within a product geometry.
 
<p> Beyond <module_ref linkend="Ap239_Task_specification_resourced:introduction"/> the  work management capabilities
 in AP239 are completed by four other modules.</p>
<p>

<module_ref linkend="Ap239_work_definition:introduction"/> uses  <module_ref linkend="scheme:introduction"/> 
to hold representations of plans and schedules, <module_ref linkend="Resource_management:introduction"/> 
to describe the intended or actual disposition of resources at locations throughout a supply chain and 
<module_ref linkend="work_request:introduction"/> and <module_ref linkend="work_order:introduction"/> to request 
and authorize activity.</p>

<p> <module_ref linkend="Ap239_product_status_recording:introduction"/> hold information on the state of realized 
products or resources at any point in time.  </p>
<p> 
<module_ref linkend="Ap239_activity_recording:introduction"/> enables similar information to be held about
completed activities.  </p>
<p>
These modules are provided to enable feedback, collected from observations of the real world, to be captured 
and related to planned activities and to applicable product designs.  An additional module 
<module_ref linkend="observations:introduction"/> is provided to record data not covered by explict entities. 
 All feedback can be characterized to provide relevant context.</p> 

<p> 
The AP module <module_ref linkend="Ap239_product_status_recording:introduction"/> enables product status to be linked 
to the activity which reported it, but otherwise is used simply to establish a single point of convergence for
 AP239 modules.</p>

<p>The final component in the data planning model <clause_ref linkend="inforeqt:data_plan:1"/>
 is 
<module_ref linkend="Ap239_management_resource_information:introduction"/>. This provides a collection
of basic concepts which can be applied to most other entities within AP239 to record who provided or authorised
any particular value at any point in time.  This module also enables the definition and assignment of
 a <module_ref linkend="class:introduction"/> to appropriate entities and attributes.  The module <module_ref linkend="external_class:introduction"/> enables
reference to be made to class definitions held in an external class library as reference data. This 
can be used to extend and to tailor AP239 to suit different business environments but applications which use different 
reference data will not be able to exchange data until the class definitions are harmonized.</p>

         This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the 
         representation of activity recording. The major difference between
         activity recording and work definition is that activity recording uses the
         'Activity as realized' module to assert that the work described has
         actually taken place. In addition, the module enables the use of
         Observations to record things which were not allowed for in the definition
         of the work. Note that, although the majority of the content of the module
         relates to the use of Observation, this is of secondary importance to the
         use of Activity as realized, covering only a few per cent of the
         requirements.

         the assignment of tasks to products and the grouping and ordering
         of tasks.  The resource allocation, and the assignment to a product, may be
         qualified by a condition, a justification or a probability.  Locations may
         be assigned to tasks and resources. 
         A task is defined by a specification that provides the instructions for carrying out the work.

   <li>definitions of document versions in a digital (<express_ref linkend="document_definition:arm:Document_definition_arm.Document_definition"/>) or physical format (<express_ref linkend="document_definition:arm:Document_definition_arm.Physical_document_definition"/>); 
   </li>

   <li>digital files (<express_ref linkend="file_identification:arm:File_identification_arm.Digital_file"/>) stored on an electronic storage device or non-digital hardcopies (<express_ref linkend="file_identification:arm:File_identification_arm.Hardcopy"/>);</li>

   <li>relationships between files (<express_ref linkend="document_structure:arm:Document_structure_arm.File_relationship"/>) or document definitions (<express_ref linkend="document_structure:arm:Document_structure_arm.Document_definition_relationship"/>);</li>

   <li>assignment of properties to a particular representation of a document version or a file (<express_ref linkend="document_properties:arm:Document_properties_arm.Assigned_document_property"/>).</li>
   </ul>
  <p>
    The 
    <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> module enables the
    definition a document.  A document is defined as a body of information that
    can be packaged for delivery on a single medium. Some examples of documents
    are: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>drawings; </li>
    <li>reports; </li>
    <li>standards; </li>
    <li>databases; </li>
    <li>application software; </li>
    <li>engineering drawings; </li>
    <li>CAD models; </li>
    <li>computer file reports; </li>
    <li>video clips; </li>
    <li>tapes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
A document may be represented by a set of digital files that collectively represents a complete digital document.  
  </p>
  <p>
Electronic document representations are sets of digital files that collectively represent the entire document.  
  </p>
  <example number="2">A set of raster files, a set of IGES files, or a combination set of raster and IGES files that represent a complete document. 
  </example>
  <p>
    Non-electronic document representations are sets of pages, sheets, cards, or 
    other medium, together with the message recorded on the medium that collectively 
    represents the entire document.  A document may have more than one document 
    representation; some of these may be electronic while others are not.  All document 
    representations of a single iteration of a particular document should have
    consistent information content; formats (both electronic and visual) may vary, but the content 
    should be the same. Different formats are different representations of the document.
  </p>
  <example number="3">Paper plots of technical drawings, Mylar traces, microfiche, or floppy disks are examples of non-digital files. 
  </example>
  <p>
    Document management provides a capability to attach, link or reference
    documents, with a limited set of metadata such as author,
    date, version title, type and encoding method;
    It also provides a capability to classify documents. 
  </p>
  <p>
Document management also provides a capability to hold definitions of "documents" which can be generated directly from data held in any format.  This provides ability to assemble documents from file, including pictures, images, videos and the results of queries on data held in any format.  Document management enables holding information contained within intelligent documents.
  </p>
   <p>
The <module_ref
linkend="ap239_management_resource_information:introduction"/> module
enables the representation and classification of management information that may
apply to document and product data.  This module combines the functionality of the following modules to extend the capability to classify documents and document information, and to provide the capability to classify and represent management information.  

</p>
<ul>
     <li><module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1288);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1246);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1114);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="external_class:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1275);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="identification_assignment:introduction"/> (ISO/TS 10303-1021);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="set_theory:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1210).</li>
</ul>
   <p>
The <module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/>
module provides the ability for other modules to assign management
information to product data.  Such management data comprises:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>dates and times;</li>
     <li>people and organizations;</li>
     <li>approvals;</li>
     <li>identifiers for items;</li>
     <li>certificates and contracts;</li>
     <li>language identification;</li>
     <li>projects;</li>
     <li>security classifications.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     In some cases this information are also applied to the management information.  For example, to specify who specified the security classification for some product data and when, requires the assignment of person and organization, and date and time to the security classification assignment. 
</p>
   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> module provides for a classification of an attribute on an EXPRESS entity.  The standard values used by the classification are defined as <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"> Classes </express_ref>.
   </p>
   <note number="2">
     The definition of the <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"/> may be stored in an external class library.
   </note>
   <note number="3">
     When the attribute of an EXPRESS entity is classified, the value of the attribute on an instance of the EXPRESS entity will be the <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class.name">name</express_ref> or  <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class.id">identifier</express_ref> of the class.
   </note>
     <p>
The <module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> module
provides for the assignment of classification information to document,
product data.  This provides a generic capability that may be specialized and further constrained in other application modules.
</p>
<p>
The <express_ref linkend="external_class:arm:External_class_arm.External_class"/>  module specifies the representation of <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class">Classes</express_ref> that are defined external to a data exchange file in an External Class Library.
</p>
<p> 
The <module_ref linkend="set_theory:introduction"/> module enables set theory relationships between document classes.  This includes the following relationships:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>complement;</li>
     <li>intersection;</li>
     <li>power set;</li>
     <li>proper subset;</li>
     <li>same membership (that is equality);</li>
     <li>subset;</li>
     <li>union.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="ap239_properties:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of properties of objects, their values and types, and classifications, in order to enable product life cycle support.
</p>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="product_as_individual:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of data that records the identification of an existing or potential future artifact - an actual product whose properties can only be known by observation or by derivation from observations.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is likely, but not essential, that the artifact, was or will be made from a version of a product design, which will be represented by the <module_ref linkend="product_identification:introduction">product_identification</module_ref>, <module_ref linkend="product_version:introduction"> product_version</module_ref> and <module_ref linkend="product_view_definition:introduction">product_view_definition</module_ref> modules.
   </p>
   <p>
     An actual product that has been made is represented by a <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/> entity.
   </p>
   <p>
     A product that is planned to be made is represented a <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_planned"/> entity.
   </p>

   <example number="4">
     The front wheel on your car is an actual product - 
     <express_ref 
       linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/>.
   </example>
   <example number="5">
     The computer with the serial number "PN X0467-71281" is an actual product -
     <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/>.
   </example>
   <example number="6">
     The plane, with tail number "GXY 8910", ordered by "Air 3000" that is just about to be manufactured is a predicted product -
     <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_planned"/>.       
   </example>

<p>
The <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the
representation of interfaces between products (see 
<clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:interface">7</clause_ref>).  
An interface is the interaction between co-functioning
products, or a product and its environment, and, in order to ensure repeatability, is the subject of an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/>.  The specification defines the
product attributes that are necessary to exist at a common boundary.</p>
<example number="7">
       Some product attributes:
<ul>
<li>fuel flow rate; </li>
	<li>required speed;</li>
	<li>operating temperature;</li>
	<li>physical shape; </li>
	<li>dimensional tolerance. </li>
</ul>
</example>
<p>
     In some industry sectors, an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/> is referred to as an Interface Control Document or Drawing. 
   </p>
<p>
An <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/> is a <express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> and, thus, may have an identification, versions, and view definitions.  
</p>
<p>
     The interaction of two interfaced products is represented by an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connection"/>.  Many types of interaction are possible. 
</p>
		<example number="8">

Some interactions: 
     <ul>
	<li>physical interaction, such as two mechanical gears meshing; </li>
	<li>optical interaction, such as an infrared connection between a remote control and a television; </li>
	<li>electrical interaction, such as the current at 240 volts, 50 hertz from a domestic supply as required by a refrigerator.  </li>
     </ul>
	</example>
<p>
     The interaction, as defined by the <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/>, is through at least one <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connector"/>. 
   </p>
<p>
An <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connector"/> is a <express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> and, thus, may have the attributes that are necessary to ensure the viability of the interface.
   </p>

			<img src="interface_picture_typical.gif"/>
		</figure>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="interface_lifecycle:introduction">Interface life cycle</module_ref> module specifies an application module for the representation of the life cycle phase of existing interfaces between actual products (as realized), and includes planned interfaces between planned products. 
     See module <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction"> ISO-10303-1251 - Interface </module_ref> for additional information. 
   </p>

   <p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_assignment:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of relationships between requirements and items to which they are assigned, and between requirements and the items which are their source.
   </p>
<p>
The <module_ref
linkend="requirement_identification_and_version:introduction"/> module
specifies the representation of the information that identify a requirement and
versions of requirements.
</p>
<note number="4">
The concept of a "requirement", in this context, relates to the exchange
and sharing of information between requirements applications such as
those used in the systems engineering and related industrial domains. 
</note>

<p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_view_definition:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of characterization views of a requirement version.
   </p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_view_definition_relationship:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of relationships between requirements which are expressed as relationships between requirement view definitions, for example, the relationships are dependent on the version of the requirement and the view of that version.
   </p>
<p> 
The <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of a type of state.
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/> module also identifies a type of state by specifying the criteria that shall be satisfied for something to be in a state of that type. 
</p>
<example number="9">A state definition that is defined by the presence of an identified type of fault in a type of product. </example> 
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of state observed.
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/> module identifies an observed state, which may be either predicted or actual, and enables it to be linked to the thing or things that are in the state.  An observed state represents a period of time when the criteria defining the state type either are or will be satisfied for one or more items.  Actual observed states therefore correspond to a period in the life of something.  States are not limited to products but may apply to activities, people, and organizations.
