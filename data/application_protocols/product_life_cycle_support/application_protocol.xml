     <description>
       <p>
         This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the 
         representation of activity recording. The major difference between
         activity recording and work definition is that activity recording uses the
         'Activity as realized' module to assert that the work described has
         actually taken place. In addition, the module enables the use of
         Observations to record things which were not allowed for in the definition
         of the work. Note that, although the majority of the content of the module
         relates to the use of Observation, this is of secondary importance to the
         use of Activity as realized, covering only a few per cent of the
         requirements.

         This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
         representation of tasks with the associated resources,
         the assignment of tasks to products and the grouping and ordering
         of tasks.  The resource allocation, and the assignment to a product, may be
         qualified by a condition, a justification or a probability.  Locations may
         be assigned to tasks and resources. 
         A task is defined by a specification that provides the instructions for carrying out the work.
         The kinds of resources that may be defined for a task are:
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           products, either types of product or individual products;
         </li>

         </li>
         <li>
           documents and information held as files.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
         Task specifications may be assigned to products, product breakdown
         elements, zones and interfaces.  
         Conditions may be stated in terms of the state of the product, its
         age, its usage or any other parameter.  Justifications can be related to
         supporting data or documents.

     The <module_ref linkend="ap239_document_management:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation and classification of documents and document information that may apply to product and document information.  This module combines the functionality of the following modules to provide the capability to classify and represent documents, document and management information.  
</p>
<ul>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1290);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="ap239_management_resource_information:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1289).</li>
</ul>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> module enables the representation of:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>information that identify documents (<express_ref linkend="document_and_version_identification:arm:Document_and_version_identification_arm.Document"/>) and versions of documents (<express_ref linkend="document_and_version_identification:arm:Document_and_version_identification_arm.Document_version"/>); </li>

   <li>
       facility to assign documents (<express_ref
linkend="document_assignment:arm:Document_assignment_arm.Document_assignment"/>)
to product data, or to assign sections of documents to product data (<express_ref linkend="document_assignment:arm:Document_assignment_arm.Partial_document_assignment"/>);
   </li>

   <li>definitions of document versions in a digital (<express_ref linkend="document_definition:arm:Document_definition_arm.Document_definition"/>) or physical format (<express_ref linkend="document_definition:arm:Document_definition_arm.Physical_document_definition"/>); 
   </li>

   <li>digital files (<express_ref linkend="file_identification:arm:File_identification_arm.Digital_file"/>) stored on an electronic storage device or non-digital hardcopies (<express_ref linkend="file_identification:arm:File_identification_arm.Hardcopy"/>);</li>

   <li>assignment of properties to a particular representation of a document version or a file (<express_ref linkend="document_properties:arm:Document_properties_arm.Assigned_document_property"/>).</li>
   </ul>
  <p>
    The 
    <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> module enables the
    definition a document.  A document is defined as a body of information that
    can be packaged for delivery on a single medium. Some examples of documents
    are: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>drawings; </li>
    <li>reports; </li>
    <li>standards; </li>
    <li>databases; </li>
    <li>application software; </li>
    <li>engineering drawings; </li>
    <li>CAD models; </li>
    <li>computer file reports; </li>
    <li>video clips; </li>
    <li>tapes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
A document may be represented by a set of digital files that collectively represents a complete digital document.  
  </p>
  <p>
Electronic document representations are sets of digital files that collectively represent the entire document.  
  </p>
  <example number="2">A set of raster files, a set of IGES files, or a combination set of raster and IGES files that represent a complete document. 
  </example>
  <p>
    Non-electronic document representations are sets of pages, sheets, cards, or 
    other medium, together with the message recorded on the medium that collectively 
    represents the entire document.  A document may have more than one document 
    representation; some of these may be electronic while others are not.  All document 
    representations of a single iteration of a particular document should have
    consistent information content; formats (both electronic and visual) may vary, but the content 
    should be the same. Different formats are different representations of the document.
  </p>
  <example number="3">Paper plots of technical drawings, Mylar traces, microfiche, or floppy disks are examples of non-digital files. 
  </example>
  <p>
    Document management provides a capability to attach, link or reference
    documents, with a limited set of metadata such as author,
    date, version title, type and encoding method;
    It also provides a capability to classify documents. 
  </p>
  <p>
Document management also provides a capability to hold definitions of "documents" which can be generated directly from data held in any format.  This provides ability to assemble documents from file, including pictures, images, videos and the results of queries on data held in any format.  Document management enables holding information contained within intelligent documents.
  </p>
   <p>
The <module_ref
linkend="ap239_management_resource_information:introduction"/> module
enables the representation and classification of management information that may
apply to document and product data.  This module combines the functionality of the following modules to extend the capability to classify documents and document information, and to provide the capability to classify and represent management information.  

</p>
<ul>
     <li><module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1288);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1246);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1114);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="external_class:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1275);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="identification_assignment:introduction"/> (ISO/TS 10303-1021);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="set_theory:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1210).</li>
</ul>
   <p>
The <module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/>
module provides the ability for other modules to assign management
information to product data.  Such management data comprises:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>dates and times;</li>
     <li>people and organizations;</li>
     <li>approvals;</li>
     <li>identifiers for items;</li>
     <li>certificates and contracts;</li>
     <li>language identification;</li>
     <li>projects;</li>
     <li>security classifications.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     In some cases this information are also applied to the management information.  For example, to specify who specified the security classification for some product data and when, requires the assignment of person and organization, and date and time to the security classification assignment. 
</p>
   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> module provides for a classification of an attribute on an EXPRESS entity.  The standard values used by the classification are defined as <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"> Classes </express_ref>.
   </p>
   <note number="2">
     The definition of the <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"/> may be stored in an external class library.
   </note>
   <note number="3">
     When the attribute of an EXPRESS entity is classified, the value of the attribute on an instance of the EXPRESS entity will be the <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class.name">name</express_ref> or  <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class.id">identifier</express_ref> of the class.
   </note>
     <p>
The <module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> module
provides for the assignment of classification information to document,
product data.  This provides a generic capability that may be specialized and further constrained in other application modules.
</p>
<p>
The <express_ref linkend="external_class:arm:External_class_arm.External_class"/>  module specifies the representation of <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class">Classes</express_ref> that are defined external to a data exchange file in an External Class Library.
</p>
<p> 
The <module_ref linkend="set_theory:introduction"/> module enables set theory relationships between document classes.  This includes the following relationships:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>complement;</li>
     <li>intersection;</li>
     <li>power set;</li>
     <li>proper subset;</li>
     <li>same membership (that is equality);</li>
     <li>subset;</li>
     <li>union.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="ap239_properties:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of properties of objects, their values and types, and classifications, in order to enable product life cycle support.
</p>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="product_as_individual:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of data that records the identification of an existing or potential future artifact - an actual product whose properties can only be known by observation or by derivation from observations.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is likely, but not essential, that the artifact, was or will be made from a version of a product design, which will be represented by the <module_ref linkend="product_identification:introduction">product_identification</module_ref>, <module_ref linkend="product_version:introduction"> product_version</module_ref> and <module_ref linkend="product_view_definition:introduction">product_view_definition</module_ref> modules.
   </p>
   <p>
     An actual product that has been made is represented by a <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/> entity.
   </p>
   <p>
     A product that is planned to be made is represented a <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_planned"/> entity.
   </p>

   <example number="4">
     The front wheel on your car is an actual product - 
     <express_ref 
       linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/>.
   </example>
   <example number="5">
     The computer with the serial number "PN X0467-71281" is an actual product -
     <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/>.
   </example>
   <example number="6">
     The plane, with tail number "GXY 8910", ordered by "Air 3000" that is just about to be manufactured is a predicted product -
     <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_planned"/>.       
   </example>

<p>
The <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the
representation of interfaces between products (see <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction:figure:f1">Figure 1</module_ref>).  An interface is the interaction between co-functioning
products, or a product and its environment, and, in order to ensure repeatability, is the subject of an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/>.  The specification defines the
product attributes that are necessary to exist at a common boundary.</p>
<example number="7">
       Some product attributes:
<ul>
<li>fuel flow rate; </li>
	<li>required speed;</li>
	<li>operating temperature;</li>
	<li>physical shape; </li>
	<li>dimensional tolerance. </li>
</ul>
</example>
<p>
     In some industry sectors, an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/> is referred to as an Interface Control Document or Drawing. 
   </p>
<p>
An <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/> is a <express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> and, thus, may have an identification, versions, and view definitions.  
</p>
<p>
     The interaction of two interfaced products is represented by an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connection"/>.  Many types of interaction are possible. 
</p>
		<example number="8">

Some interactions: 
     <ul>
	<li>physical interaction, such as two mechanical gears meshing; </li>
	<li>optical interaction, such as an infrared connection between a remote control and a television; </li>
	<li>electrical interaction, such as the current at 240 volts, 50 hertz from a domestic supply as required by a refrigerator.  </li>
     </ul>
	</example>
<p>
     The interaction, as defined by the <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/>, is through at least one <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connector"/>. 
   </p>
<p>
An <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connector"/> is a <express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> and, thus, may have the attributes that are necessary to ensure the viability of the interface.
   </p>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="interface_lifecycle:introduction">Interface life cycle</module_ref> module specifies an application module for the representation of the life cycle phase of existing interfaces between actual products (as realized), and includes planned interfaces between planned products. 
     See module <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction"> ISO-10303-1251 - Interface </module_ref> for additional information. 
   </p>

   <p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_assignment:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of relationships between requirements and items to which they are assigned, and between requirements and the items which are their source.
   </p>
<p>
The <module_ref
linkend="requirement_identification_and_version:introduction"/> module
specifies the representation of the information that identify a requirement and
versions of requirements.
</p>
<note number="4">
The concept of a "requirement", in this context, relates to the exchange
and sharing of information between requirements applications such as
those used in the systems engineering and related industrial domains. 
</note>

<p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_view_definition:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of characterization views of a requirement version.
   </p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_view_definition_relationship:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of relationships between requirements which are expressed as relationships between requirement view definitions, for example, the relationships are dependent on the version of the requirement and the view of that version.
   </p>
<p> 
The <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of a type of state.
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/> module also identifies a type of state by specifying the criteria that shall be satisfied for something to be in a state of that type. 
</p>
<example number="9">A state definition that is defined by the presence of an identified type of fault in a type of product. </example> 
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of state observed.
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/> module identifies an observed state, which may be either predicted or actual, and enables it to be linked to the thing or things that are in the state.  An observed state represents a period of time when the criteria defining the state type either are or will be satisfied for one or more items.  Actual observed states therefore correspond to a period in the life of something.  States are not limited to products but may apply to activities, people, and organizations.
