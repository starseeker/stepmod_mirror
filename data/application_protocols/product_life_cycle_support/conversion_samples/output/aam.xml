<activity identifier="A4" inscope="yes">
  <name>Provide support</name>
  <description>Apply the support solution to one or more product needing support.</description>
  <note>This activity includes planning of support delivery, provision and disposal of necessary resources, implementation of authorized tasks and collection and reporting of operational and support feedback.

Support elements include:

- personnel;

- support equipment;

- facilities;

- support resources (technical data, training, and so on);

- maintenance;

- repair;

- replacement (spare) parts;

- feedback.

The "Provide support" activity, from a maintenance perspective, includes the maintenance solution that is a subset of the support solution containing technical data, tailored to a specific system support plan, which identifies maintenance and support resource requirements to maintain systems, equipment, and support equipment in an operationally ready state.  The maintenance solution contains the complete subset of support engineering approved maintenance tasks developed for the support solution.

The maintenance solution includes:

- task names and descriptions;

- where to do the maintenance, including the facilities required;

- why the maintenance is being done, including a failure mode or being preventative;

- identification of any approvals that are necessary (quality assurance inspections, tests, and so on).

The task descriptions include:

- how to perform the task;

- an appropriate level of detail in task steps;

- what to use in terms of resources that include parts, support equipment, certifications and qualifications, and people;

- when to do the task, including intervals between maintenance events stated in terms of appropriate measurement (days, hours, cycles, on condition, and so on).

Maintenance planning identifies maintenance tasks to be accomplished and the time phasing for all levels of maintenance, including both preventive and unscheduled maintenance as part of the support solution.  Maintenance planning produces a maintenance plan that is specific to an actual product and details procedures for carrying out specific jobs, tasks, or projects in a maintenance program.  The plan fixes the time when maintenance operations are to begin or be completed, and ensures that all resources (including materials, labor, support equipment, facilities, documentation) are also scheduled for availability at the time maintenance is performed.

Maintenance plans and schedules have specific planning horizons such as annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily.  Each schedule is a subset of the larger time period covered under the plan.  Maintenance tasks are scheduled against a specific Product in Focus.  The maintenance schedule contains all scheduled jobs and tasks, beginning and completion trigger events such as time, cycles, hours, and lists specific resources and locations where the work package, job, or task will be accomplished.

Sustainability consists of the attributes and status of a system and its supporting logistics infrastructure that enable a Product in Focus to maintain its capability during the course of operations.  Sustainability is commonly used in conjunction with the term readiness.  Sustainability is influenced by inherent design characteristics, age, and support infrastructure (manpower, training, spares provisioning, technical data, and so on).  A system may be ready to begin operations, but may not be able to sustain operations (for example, maintain sortie generation rates) required by operational plans.

Sustained Maintenance Planning (SMP) encompasses continual review of established maintenance plans to ensure the most cost effective, safe maintenance is being performed on in-service support systems.  System age, changes in material conditions, failure modes, and operational environment are continually analyzed to ensure that safe, affordable, readiness is maintained.  Emphasis is placed on use of reliability centered maintenance (RCM) as a continual life-cycle process to establish and adjust preventive maintenance requirements.

  <note>Ap239 provides a generic mechanism for representing product assemblies or product breakdowns from any required perspective.  A product assembly breakdown is usually developed by the engineering design process. This is used to define the parts and versions which make up the product and to develop a bill of material for product manufacture.  Life cycle support activities will usually require the establishment of other product breakdowns views to show, for example, a decomposition of product functions from the operator or maintainer perspective and, in some cases, a zonal description of the product to assist maintenance planning.  Each breakdown will contain similar classified elements, linked together in a hierarchical fashion.  </note>

  <name>Identify product structure view</name>
  <description>Define which product breakdown views are required by relevant stakeholders and support participants, to storing, search and retrieve product and support information.</description>
  <note>The product structure is a representation of product hierarchy (a product tree) from top down to the lowest level.  Each level will potentially include references to associated configuration documentation such as engineering models, bills of materials, specifications, software requirements, design documents, processes and operating procedures.  The fundamentals for a product structure are:

- a single set of elements, which can be parts, materials, and proprietary items;

- a unique product structure;

- a set of allowed product structure views.

The product structure views include:

- functional view, which is a hierarchical structure, depicting parent-child relationships and is constructed to support the definition of the Product in Focus in terms of functionality, certification, qualification, operation, maintenance and support in a auditable manner;

- physical view, which is a hierarchical structure, depicting parent-child relationships and is constructed to represent how the build of the Product in Focus will be achieved and the impacts of any change to the Product in Focus.

Aspects can be viewed as:

- as designed;

- as planned;

- as built;

- as maintained.

The as-designed view holds specifications, forecasts, plans and so on against high-level definitions that are expanded as the Product in Focus progresses through the life-cycle.  The view is initially completed when containing how the product operates.  This view is maintained throughout the life-cycle to reflect authorized changes.  The as-planned view is populated with lower level elements defining the way the Product in Focus is to be assembled.  The as-built view is how the Product in Focus has been built up to the point of delivery.  The as-maintained view is populated with the support information from the point of delivery until disposal and will contain all change information.

Elements within a product structure will have both private view and public view information linked to them and this information will have to be managed.</note>

- determination of the appropriate level of identification marking of product and documentation;

- unique identification of a product or component part of a product;

- unique identification of the technical documents describing the product;

- modification of identification of product and documents to reflect incorporation of change;

- distinction between product versions;

- correlation of document revision level to product version;

- correlation of a Product in Focus to related user or maintenance instructions at the configuration item level.

To achieve consistency of product characteristics and information about these characteristics, the performance, functional and physical requirements are first defined in configuration documentation.  These requirements must then be achieved in a product.  Consistency is maintained throughout the product life-cycle by identifying and evaluating the impact of all changes through the activity "Manage configuration change" (A1.1).  The activity "Manage information" (A1.3) covers verification that the product and all associated product information and documentation has been updated and continues to be consistent.</note>

  <name>Manage information</name>
  <description>Manage the information related to a Product in Focus.</description>
  <note>This activity corresponds to configuration and data management (CDM) and the major output is Assured Product and Support Information (APSI), which encompasses the entire configuration and support data.  A subset of the APSI is the configuration status record (CSR).  The dynamic nature of the CDM activity, and its importance within the operation of a consistent configuration management process throughout the product life-cycle requires a formal approval process to attain APSI status.  All configuration documentation (requirements and design documentation) and associated operational information (operating procedures, parts catalogues, and so on) that comprise the CSR must be formally managed and approved.  In essence, approve, release and record is a process that makes configuration and support documentation available for use, subjects it to configuration change management (CCM) and formally maintains the APSI.</note>

The preliminary judgments concern:

- the reason for the requested change;

- the basic scope and description of the requested change;

- definition of the impact of the requested change;

  <note>This activity results in a valid need for change, enabling the change to be effectively processed and helping to ensure that the associated configuration documentation provides a comprehensive historical record of the full life-cycle of the change.  To adequately evaluate a request for change, the request must be clearly documented.  It is important to accurately describe even minor changes so that an audit trail can be constructed in the event that there are unanticipated consequences or unexpected product failures.  Saving the cost of research involved in one such incident by having accurate accessible records may be sufficient to fully offset diligent, disciplined change processing.  Changes may be required as a result of problems reported during design, build, test, operations and service activities.

Changes are initiated for a variety of reasons including:

- to provide new capabilities desired by a customer;

- to enhance product support;

- to insert new technology;

- to effect product improvement;

- to cater for obsolescence;

- to correct product faults or deficiencies;

- to correct problems and prevent recurrence;

- to eliminate safety hazard conditions;

- to implement pre-planned product improvement;

- to reduce production cost or improve production efficiency;

- to prevent schedule slippage;

  <name>Establish business solution &amp; authorize change</name>
  <description>Establish the business case for change and select the preferred solution.  Authorize the change by approval of appropriate change orders to enable the change to be implemented and verified.</description>
  <note>Change approval should be conducted in accordance with the configuration management plan.  Approval authority for a change can be delegated to different levels in the organization, dependant upon the classification of the change.  As the life-cycle progresses, the change authority often transitions to individuals with greater management and fiscal responsibility because the effect of a change can be more widespread and, as a result, the cost impact of change decisions are normally greater.  Each contract should establish a specific change authority structure taking some of the following factors into consideration:

- the organizational structure and relationships within the enterprise;

- the various levels at which change authority is vested;

- the phase of the product life-cycle;

- the extent of technical, support, schedule and cost impacts;

- the customer involvement;

- the product attributes subject to formal control;

- the period of performance during which that level of control applies.

The most complex multi-level configuration management is practiced on projects in which authority for making change decisions is structured around tiered change boards.  The change approval authorities span many contractor and customer organizations each with defined limited authority to approve changes to the portion of the system under their control.  Those changes, which exceed the authority of lower level change approval authorities, are elevated to a higher level.</note>

<activity identifier="A18" inscope="yes">
  <name>Plan change</name>
  <description>Establish which members of the Product in Focus are to be changed, including both production and retrofit as necessary.</description>
  <note>There are many influencing factors on this activity including an assessment of the urgency and priority of the change and the availability of parts and materials, software and replacement parts.  Determining an effectivity requires knowledge not only of the lead times associated with changing the product (whether in production or by retrofit, recall or other means) but of the actions and lead times necessary to effect the associated change in all impacted support areas (such as the update of support software, availability of spare and repair parts, or revision to operating and maintenance instructions).  Once the change is approved detailed implementation planning, which expands but remains consistent with the basic planning is normally required.  Implementation of a change involves the release of new or revised configuration documentation including requirements and design information.  This implementation may involve changes to information on operation and maintenance, build and test, and commercial documentation.  The new or revised information is identified and released within the activity "Manage information" (A1.3).  The release process ties the document revisions to a change.  It is not always necessary to have a plan before a change task can be authorized.  However, a change implementation plan is always needed.</note>

Justification and reconciliation must be carried out for each of the potential solutions proposed.

Treating a complex product or system as a single configuration item may not provide sufficient visibility from both a supplier and customer management perspective.  Designating a system component as a configuration item increases visibility and management control throughout the development and support phases.  For system critical or high technical risk items, added visibility can help in meeting specified requirements and timescales.

At least one configuration item should be designated for each development contract in order to provide the required visibility and management control.  Items such as development environment or test facility that are not end products or deliverable items in their right but are critical to the definition, development, production or delivery of an end product may be designated as configuration items. For complex products and systems, major functional design components are usually designated as configuration items, the initial selection being based upon the major items within the work breakdown structure (WBS).

As a product or system evolves during development, and the understanding of that item becomes more mature, a series of sub-components may be identified.  These may or may not require designating as configuration items.  The developing authority should generally be given maximum latitude to develop below the system (configuration item) level unless developments impact agreed baselines in any way.  Each configuration item should implement at least one end use function in its own right and be clearly distinguishable from other configuration items at the same level.  This will help to ensure that configuration item designation is kept to a systems level and should help to minimize the number of configuration items.

Subordinate configuration items should be functionally interrelated with each other and with the upper level configuration item.  This should not be at the expense of overly complex interfaces within a system, which may tend to increase risk and ultimately cost.  Operational software items typically control the functionality of a product or system and as such typically warrant being designated as a separate configuration item.  Caution needs to be exercised with complex products containing a high degree of computer-controlled functionality so that the overall number of configuration items is optimized. Designating configuration items for operational software items at a systems level is the key here.  All sub-assemblies of a configuration item should have common mission, installation, deployment, and support requirements.

A unique component that is peculiar to only one of multiple similar products or systems should be identified as a separate configuration item of that system.  This may be particularly relevant to export orders where the customer is obtaining an established product but with their own tailoring (for example, different avionics).  In such cases, it is the differences that will be significant to both customer and contractor.

Off-the-shelf items should generally not be considered as configuration items unless they are modified before embodiment within a product or system.  Significant factors to consider are the extent of the modification and the criticality of the item to the product or system.  Generally, any non-developmental item designated for logistic support by the customer should be designated a configuration item, and the customer should be provided with sufficient configuration documentation to enable such support activities.</note>

The new or revised information is identified and released as APSI.  The release process should correlate the document revisions to the change or changes incorporated.
