Is shading allowed in tables?  The SD's use shading to distinguish examples from the text, 
but since shading is not allowed in figures, I suspect it is not allowed in tables.

Assuming the issue is against "Figure 2 Market segmentation", the figure is
a figure, not a table.
Furthermore, how are you supposed to convey the information without shading?

    SC4 Response:  In view of the need to maintain configuration control
    across a modular structure, SC4 will need to refer to specific dated issues
    of modules.  This requirement will be reviewed as modules become

RBN - I presume you mean replace:
"      The following normative documents contain provisions which, through
      reference in this text, constitute provisions of this International
      Standard. For dated references, subsequent amendments to, or revisions of,
      any of these publications do not apply. However, parties to agreements
      based on this International Standard are encouraged to investigate the
      possibility of applying the most recent editions of the normative documents
      indicated below. For undated references, the latest edition of the
      normative document referred to applies. Members of ISO and IEC maintain
      registers of currently valid International Standards."

4 Information Requirements

  NOTE 1  The information requirements correspond to those of the activities identified as being within the scope of this application protocol in Annex E.

The reference should be to Annex F, not Annex E.  (The hyperlink actually goes to Annex F.)

Since there is only one note in the section, this note should not be numbered.

We regret that the information was not available. 
However, since the ballot further significant validation work has been done
in the form of documenting the model as OASIS Data Exchange Sets. (http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=plcs) This
  work can be accessed at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dexlib. This work
is ongoing. In addition there are several pilot deployments of PLCS, such
as the use of PLCS by Norwegian Defence to acquire though life information
for Frigates. This is contributing to the development of the DEXs.

 </p>
 <p>
The scope of the standard is not clear. It is not clear were the
distinction to e.g. AP 233 is.  Something like a competition with other APs
is wasting resources and should be avoided, e.g. System Product Structure
&amp; Functional Product Structure [ISO 10303-1216 ] should be domiciled
in AP233.</p> 
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Please improve the scope and describe a clear separation to other emerging standards.</p>
 </description>

<comment

<description>
The sharing of module between APs is deliberate to foster harmonization and
common implementation. As a result of this comment we will change the
introduction to improve the description with AP233. (The penultimate
paragraph in the Introduction)

<comment

<description>
	Additional words added to the introduction to cover the relationship to AP233. 
	While AP233 is not published, this is as far as we can go. 
	There has been a lot of effort put into the relationship between AP239 and AP233. 
	The aim has been to ensure compatibility rather than competition, 
	recognising that Systems Engineering is an important related discipline to Product Support.

   <b>(6) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
In SC4 Standing Document (N1686), "Guidelines for the content of application protocols that use application modules", 4.4 describes as follows for the content of Scope of Modular AP document.

"Clause 1 of an AP shall define the domain of the AP and summarize the fundamental concepts and assumptions of the scope, the functionality of the AP, and the types of information that are accommodated by the AP. A description of the functionality and information that are specifically outside the scope of the application shall be defined to clarify the domain of the AP."

N1686 also describes as follows by NOTE 2 in 4.4.

"The required text of the scope clause is generated by the SC4 Module Repository. The scope bullets are derived from the AP Module. Paragraphs describing the domain of application are added by the AP editor."

The current Scope clause of AP239 describes only functions that are derived from AP Module. It does not include any descriptions about domain of the AP nor fundamental concepts that will be useful for the readers of this document.
</p>
 <p>
   <b>(7) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
It is recommended to add such descriptions as follows in the context of within the scope and outside the scope.

1) Main activities of AAM within the scope,
e.g. titles of activities of A0 diagram
-to manage information to support a product
-to generate support solutions
-to commission support system
-to provide support

2) Information model to support industrial domain specific application is outside the scope.

3) Which of life cycle stages is within the scope, and which is outside the scope.

		Japan has noted that 221 scope includes more description and that the scope of -239 and -439 are identical. 
		Need to address this - noting that 239 scope is automatically constructed. Add some AP specific text.

The description of 4.7.2 in SC4 Standing Document (N1686), "Guidelines for the content of application protocols that use application modules" does not mention how to display the index.

   <b>(3) Paragraph:</b> Task Feedback (Arrow)
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
2 years ago it was considered that at the A-0/AO level of the model that a generic 'feedback' line was sufficient to indicate an input activity that needed action type work. Activity box A1 maintained this simple generic name instead of 'hundreds of types'. A1 now identifies a Task Feedback (TF) input to box A11
The TF arrow definition "information, in any form, derived from observation of a realized activity including progress, findings or resource use, prior to the capture of this information in the format required by the IM rules" seems inappropriate in areas of the model in which it is used For example on A113 'Evaluate and Co-ord Solution and Variance TF is used to bring 2 (two) feedback returns; business impact of solution and solution definition report into 1131, and 1132,1133. The requests were issued 'under' IM rules therefore TF is inappropriate or the definition is incorrect





</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
. Overall within the context of A1/A11/A12/A13 TF is totally inappropriate.
Revert to 'feedback', "information of relevance to support that is derived from experience or observation - In combination with other inputs to the configuration management activities feedback may prompt the need for a change and assist the development of a change.  Feedback may include:
- work requests or issues that may lead to change;
- requests for identifiers for product or support elements;
- impact reports in response to change tasks;
- status reports on progress with change tasks;
- support and commissioning feedback.

Rejected.  Task feedback is the arrow between A43 and A44.  A44 transforms task feedback 
into support feedback.  Support feedback becomes a constituent of the generic
feedback arrow.  Arrow decomposition is good IDEF0 modelling style.

2 years ago it was considered that at the A-0/AO level of the model that a generic 'feedback' line was sufficient to indicate an input activity that needed action type work. Why is OF required when it dealt with within the AAM as Support Feedback "information provided to support authorities by operators including information on product health and usage, and equipment problems discovered by operators - May include trouble reports, log books and other data from on board recording systems, passed to support authorities for analysis.  The operator feedback is structured to conform to the information management rules by activity A4.4 and is communicated within this model by the support feedback arrow."

The definition of variance has changed from the CM agreed definition in 2.13

 <p>
Arrow Note: 1. Design Intent includes the design of the support system, the manufacturing system etc.
Acceptance of a Variance does not change the PIF baseline.
2. Different organizations have one or more words to describe departures from the design baseline, thus this definition is intended to cover terms such as:  waiver, concession, non-conformance, production permit, acceptable fault etc.

 </p>
 <p>
The definition of 'required structures' states 'the set of product assembly or breakdown views that the life cycle owner requires to establish and maintain the PIF' This is a CONSTRAINT on box A1221 'Develop Structure Views which flows down to A12212 'LOAD PRODUCT ASSEMBLY STRUCTURE'- which is defined as 'action to import the design assembly structure for each product variant and version for each product within the PIF scope' The output arrow from this activity is a 'product assembly.
Phew!!! The problem as I see it is that this product view is the basic catalyst for the rest of theA1221 activities of creating 'breakdowns' BUT there is no input arrow from A12212 to the rest of the 4 other boxes

 <p>
This arrow which is an output from A2422 is defined as "Requests to the life cycle owner to address issues identified by the task analysis activity - This may include:
-  requests to designers to assess the feasibility of changing the product to improve supportability;
- requests to investigate the feasibility of changing the product design to meet support solution requirements by improving reliability or preventing a failure mode;
- notification of potential health, safety and environmental risks identified by the task analysis that may require design activity;
- notification of constraints imposed by support activity on the intended use of the product;
- requests for action to identify or modify existing resources required by tasks;
- requests for the provision of new resource capability, which may lead to updates of resource item descriptions within a deployment environment.
Therefore the arrow should read requirements to design.
It is also noted t hat a requirement as changed to a request</p>

 <p>
Certainly 12214 is a villain and has no place in the PLCS AAM model. We had a long debate over the PLCS exploders in '03 about "Logistically Significant Item", "Maintenance Significant Item" etc. The experts, including myself, maintained that such designations had no place in the definition of product breakdown views. At best, they can be used to qualify a node in a breakdown, but one man's scrap is another man's repairable

 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(3) Paragraph:</b> 
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
The AAM does not appear to cover the life cycle of a product. E.g. under A1221 the node A12212 refers to loading an assembly structure. Where does this come from and why is there no Develop Assembly Structure activity? The model assumes that the assembly (&amp; design) have already been developed (elsewhere). It is not clear that the design activity is outside of the scope of PLCS.



</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Either,
Redesign this AAM, or
Create the relevant activity breakdown for the development of the assembly. This may also require earlier dependant activities to be defined e.g. the design, requirements etc..,
Or, add design to the out of scope statement.

 <p>
Only 2 (ISO 10303-1287 (AP239 activity recording) &amp; ISO 10303-1304 (AP239 product status recording)) of the 5 implementation models for AP239 are provided in section 5.1. Where are the rest?
</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Include mappings for;
ISO 10303-1292 AP239 product definition information
ISO 10303-1307 AP239 work definition
ISO 10303-1306 AP239 task specification resourced

Clause 5.1 Mapping specification is the mapping specification of the AP
module ap239_product_life_cycle_support. The module simply uses from:
  </p>
  <screen>
    USE FROM Ap239_activity_recording_mim;    --  ISO/TS 10303-1287
    USE FROM Ap239_product_status_recording_mim;    --  ISO/TS 10303-1304
  </screen>
  <p>
    There is nothing in the module to map, hence the XSL refers to the two
    modules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arguably we could allow modules to be explicitly listed, but why should
    this type of module be treated any differently?

<comment

<description>
It was agreed at the San Diego SC4 meeting that conformance classes could
only really be sensibly defined once the AP had been in business use for a
while. Consequently, new APs can define a single conformance class. Once
the PLCS DEXs have been completed and are in use, an issue will be raised
against the AP239 to add the appropriate DEXs as AP239 conformance
classes. At this stage, the DEXs are too immature to be proposed as
  conformance classes.

<description>
The text used in Clause 6 and in Annex D "Protocol Implementation
Conformance Statement (PICS) proforma" is taken directly from the
supplementary directives and from "Guidelines for the content of
application protocols that use application modules, ISO TC184/SC4/N1686,
2004-02-25." If additional text is required then a SEDS should be raised
against those two documents. As this is the first edition of the standard
and as its scope is wider than current software implementations, it was
agreed at a previous ISO meeting that only one conformance class was to be
provided which covered the scope of the AP. As experience was gained
deploying the standard appropriate conformance classes would be identified
and incorporated in a future edition of the standard. This work is being
undertaken by the 
"OASIS Product Life Cycle Support (PLCS) TC"
http://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/plcs/index.php
where conformance classes are being developed as Data Exchange Sets (DEXS).
This is referred to Annex H.

The index that you refer to is the index for the AP document. There is a
complete index referencing all the modules, arm, mim objects and 
mappings in a separate frame. Perhaps we should add a set of hyperlink in
the AP document index that links to these indexes to make their existence more obvious.

Given that PLCS/Oasis have decided to use the technique of "classification" to replace the use of many id &amp; role attributes of the PLCS model, should this information be placed within the annex on Implementation method specific requirements. This would be logical since there already exists advice on the representation of empty strings and the like.</p>

Under the "AP index" link, the two indices "Module ARMs" and "Module MIMs" work differently. The latter sorts with "_" before blank and the former vice versa (i.e. "activity" before "activity_as_realized".

  The comment refers to the definition of the TITLE in clause 5.1.
  That is the title of that which is being mapped in the mapping clause. This may well be an attribute.

  In Annex A of the AP document, it states that
  "The ARM EXPRESS expanded listing for this part of ISO 10303 is provided in
Annex E of the AP module,"
  The link to Annex E is to the EXPRESS, not the Annex. The XSL should be fixed.

All the modules and APs have a bibliographic entry:

Bibliography

I presume that this should be:

In Annex I, the identification discussion uses Name attribute on a Part. We should use
Identification_assignment to assign a Name, rather than use the "Name"
attributes. 
Where a name is used as an identification, then Identification_assignment
should be used to assign a Name.
We would need to classify the identification as "name"
