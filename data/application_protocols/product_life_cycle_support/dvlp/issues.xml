Is shading allowed in tables?  The SD's use shading to distinguish examples from the text, 
but since shading is not allowed in figures, I suspect it is not allowed in tables.

<description>
Assuming the issue is against "Figure 2 Market segmentation", the figure is
a figure, not a table.
Furthermore, how are you supposed to convey the information without shading?

the words "for example" is in one of the scope statements, which means it should be tagged as an example.

The scope is pulled from the AP module. The scope has been fixed in the AP module.

Only two modules are referenced in the ARM and MIM short form, yet there
are many modules listed in the normative references.  Please explain why
all these references are needed.

There was an agreement at Poitiers that the higher level modules in an
AP should be described in clause 4, so they are needed as they are
normatively described in clause 4.

ISO CS has been questioning the use of dated references.  Is it necessary
to refer only to the versions listed?  Or could undated references be used?

this will be a biggish change to the XSL - also, it will affect the
modules, a number of which are on their way to ISO.

Use boilerplate specified in ISO Directives, Part 2:

"The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies."

RBN - I presume you mean replace:
"      The following normative documents contain provisions which, through
      reference in this text, constitute provisions of this International
      Standard. For dated references, subsequent amendments to, or revisions of,
      any of these publications do not apply. However, parties to agreements
      based on this International Standard are encouraged to investigate the
      possibility of applying the most recent editions of the normative documents
      indicated below. For undated references, the latest edition of the
      normative document referred to applies. Members of ISO and IEC maintain
      registers of currently valid International Standards."
I have replaced it.

3.18 Abbreviations

ASPI: Why are all words except "set" capitalized?

The acronym FAA stands for "Federal Aviation Administration".

RBN - because the acronym is: APSI - Assured set of Product and Support Information "set" is not part of the acronym.

4 Information Requirements

  NOTE 1  The information requirements correspond to those of the activities identified as being within the scope of this application protocol in Annex E.

The reference should be to Annex F, not Annex E.  (The hyperlink actually goes to Annex F.)

Since there is only one note in the section, this note should not be numbered.

The figure 1 is confusing. Are the 8 boxes on the left (labelled Product
Structure - Support Performance) held in the Disc/Database labelled Life
Cycle Shared Data? If so, the diagram is confusing: if not, where are they
stored?

revision. The content is the same, but the revision numbers have been
updated. The latest images should be used.

html errors reported by homesite, in clause TOCs  and in contents.xml. These are  caused by hrefs to non-existent contents.xml#copyright.  Should these , as in the modules, point instead to cover.xml#copyright (also non-existent, at the moment)?
