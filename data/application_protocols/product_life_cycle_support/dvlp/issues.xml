Is shading allowed in tables?  The SD's use shading to distinguish examples from the text, 
but since shading is not allowed in figures, I suspect it is not allowed in tables.

Assuming the issue is against "Figure 2 Market segmentation", the figure is
a figure, not a table.
Furthermore, how are you supposed to convey the information without shading?

    SC4 Response:  In view of the need to maintain configuration control
    across a modular structure, SC4 will need to refer to specific dated issues
    of modules.  This requirement will be reviewed as modules become

Use boilerplate specified in ISO Directives, Part 2:

"The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies."

RBN - I presume you mean replace:
"      The following normative documents contain provisions which, through
      reference in this text, constitute provisions of this International
      Standard. For dated references, subsequent amendments to, or revisions of,
      any of these publications do not apply. However, parties to agreements
      based on this International Standard are encouraged to investigate the
      possibility of applying the most recent editions of the normative documents
      indicated below. For undated references, the latest edition of the
      normative document referred to applies. Members of ISO and IEC maintain
      registers of currently valid International Standards."
I have replaced it.

4 Information Requirements

  NOTE 1  The information requirements correspond to those of the activities identified as being within the scope of this application protocol in Annex E.

The reference should be to Annex F, not Annex E.  (The hyperlink actually goes to Annex F.)

Since there is only one note in the section, this note should not be numbered.

The scope of the standard is not clear. It is not clear were the distinction to e.g. AP 233 is.  Something like a competition with other APs is wasting resources and should be avoided, e.g. System Product Structure &amp; Functional Product Structure [ISO 10303-1216 ] should be domiciled  in AP233.</p>

 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(4) Paragraph:</b> Overall
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
In SC4 Standing Document (N1686), "Guidelines for the content of application protocols that use application modules", 4.4 describes as follows for the content of Scope of Modular AP document.

"Clause 1 of an AP shall define the domain of the AP and summarize the fundamental concepts and assumptions of the scope, the functionality of the AP, and the types of information that are accommodated by the AP. A description of the functionality and information that are specifically outside the scope of the application shall be defined to clarify the domain of the AP."

N1686 also describes as follows by NOTE 2 in 4.4.

"The required text of the scope clause is generated by the SC4 Module Repository. The scope bullets are derived from the AP Module. Paragraphs describing the domain of application are added by the AP editor."

The current Scope clause of AP239 describes only functions that are derived from AP Module. It does not include any descriptions about domain of the AP nor fundamental concepts that will be useful for the readers of this document.



</p>
 <p>
   <b>(7) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
It is recommended to add such descriptions as follows in the context of within the scope and outside the scope.

1) Main activities of AAM within the scope,
e.g. titles of activities of A0 diagram
-to manage information to support a product
-to generate support solutions
-to commission support system
-to provide support

2) Information model to support industrial domain specific application is outside the scope.

3) Which of life cycle stages is within the scope, and which is outside the scope.

The ARM EXPRESS index and the module index are displayed in the left side frame when the word "index" is clicked for HTML version.

 <p>
How should the number of members of a group be modelled? Is the use of Assigned_property adequate or are there other means?</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
We feel that the number of members is not a property, but a value that is derived from the nature of the group. Something like a derived property would probably be adequate.</p>

 <p>
   <b>(3) Paragraph:</b> Task Feedback (Arrow)
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
2 years ago it was considered that at the A-0/AO level of the model that a generic 'feedback' line was sufficient to indicate an input activity that needed action type work. Activity box A1 maintained this simple generic name instead of 'hundreds of types'. A1 now identifies a Task Feedback (TF) input to box A11
The TF arrow definition "information, in any form, derived from observation of a realized activity including progress, findings or resource use, prior to the capture of this information in the format required by the IM rules" seems inappropriate in areas of the model in which it is used For example on A113 'Evaluate and Co-ord Solution and Variance TF is used to bring 2 (two) feedback returns; business impact of solution and solution definition report into 1131, and 1132,1133. The requests were issued 'under' IM rules therefore TF is inappropriate or the definition is incorrect





</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
. Overall within the context of A1/A11/A12/A13 TF is totally inappropriate.
Revert to 'feedback', "information of relevance to support that is derived from experience or observation - In combination with other inputs to the configuration management activities feedback may prompt the need for a change and assist the development of a change.  Feedback may include:
- work requests or issues that may lead to change;
- requests for identifiers for product or support elements;
- impact reports in response to change tasks;
- status reports on progress with change tasks;
- support and commissioning feedback.

2 years ago it was considered that at the A-0/AO level of the model that a generic 'feedback' line was sufficient to indicate an input activity that needed action type work. Why is OF required when it dealt with within the AAM as Support Feedback "information provided to support authorities by operators including information on product health and usage, and equipment problems discovered by operators - May include trouble reports, log books and other data from on board recording systems, passed to support authorities for analysis.  The operator feedback is structured to conform to the information management rules by activity A4.4 and is communicated within this model by the support feedback arrow."

 </p>
 <p>
The definition of variance has changed from the CM agreed definition in 2.13

WAS - A departure from the design intent as reflected in the Assured Product and Support Information.
</p>

   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Arrow Note: 1. Design Intent includes the design of the support system, the manufacturing system etc.
Acceptance of a Variance does not change the PIF baseline.
2. Different organizations have one or more words to describe departures from the design baseline, thus this definition is intended to cover terms such as:  waiver, concession, non-conformance, production permit, acceptable fault etc.

   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
The definition of 'required structures' states 'the set of product assembly or breakdown views that the life cycle owner requires to establish and maintain the PIF' This is a CONSTRAINT on box A1221 'Develop Structure Views which flows down to A12212 'LOAD PRODUCT ASSEMBLY STRUCTURE'- which is defined as 'action to import the design assembly structure for each product variant and version for each product within the PIF scope' The output arrow from this activity is a 'product assembly.
Phew!!! The problem as I see it is that this product view is the basic catalyst for the rest of theA1221 activities of creating 'breakdowns' BUT there is no input arrow from A12212 to the rest of the 4 other boxes
</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Make a12212 the feeder into the rest of the activity boxes on A1221

Define Potential Task - Box A2422 activity is defined as 'action to define the method by which a potential task shall be performed, including sequencing of steps within the task, requirements for additional or consequential tasks, warnings and cautions applicable to the task, the identification of task predecessors and successors, the task pre- and post-conditions and the support resources required to achieve the task, including necessary skills and experience'
A2422Output arrow 'request for task procedure' (defined as a request for the development of a task procedure for an intended task not addressed by the support solution definition) is an input to A24211 Identify potential tasks whose ONLY sensible OUTPUT is which is defined as a support driver for which no effective response can be found.

 <p>
   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
This arrow which is an output from A2422 is defined as "Requests to the life cycle owner to address issues identified by the task analysis activity - This may include:
-  requests to designers to assess the feasibility of changing the product to improve supportability;
- requests to investigate the feasibility of changing the product design to meet support solution requirements by improving reliability or preventing a failure mode;
- notification of potential health, safety and environmental risks identified by the task analysis that may require design activity;
- notification of constraints imposed by support activity on the intended use of the product;
- requests for action to identify or modify existing resources required by tasks;
- requests for the provision of new resource capability, which may lead to updates of resource item descriptions within a deployment environment.
Therefore the arrow should read requirements to design.
It is also noted t hat a requirement as changed to a request</p>

 <p>
Certainly 12214 is a villain and has no place in the PLCS AAM model. We had a long debate over the PLCS exploders in '03 about "Logistically Significant Item", "Maintenance Significant Item" etc. The experts, including myself, maintained that such designations had no place in the definition of product breakdown views. At best, they can be used to qualify a node in a breakdown, but one man's scrap is another man's repairable

 <p>
   <b>(3) Paragraph:</b> 
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
The AAM does not appear to cover the life cycle of a product. E.g. under A1221 the node A12212 refers to loading an assembly structure. Where does this come from and why is there no Develop Assembly Structure activity? The model assumes that the assembly (&amp; design) have already been developed (elsewhere). It is not clear that the design activity is outside of the scope of PLCS.



</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Either,
Redesign this AAM, or
Create the relevant activity breakdown for the development of the assembly. This may also require earlier dependant activities to be defined e.g. the design, requirements etc..,
Or, add design to the out of scope statement.

Clause 5.1 Mapping specification is the mapping specification of the AP
module ap239_product_life_cycle_support. The module simply uses from:
  </p>
  <screen>
    USE FROM Ap239_activity_recording_mim;    --  ISO/TS 10303-1287
    USE FROM Ap239_product_status_recording_mim;    --  ISO/TS 10303-1304
  </screen>
  <p>
    There is nothing in the module to map, hence the XSL refers to the two
    modules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arguably we could allow modules to be explicitly listed, but why should
    this type of module be treated any differently?

The index appears to list mainly terms defined in the AAM and the implementation modules. Nothing else - which would seem too short for a document like this.</p>

There is a complete index referencing all the modules, arm, mim objects and

   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Given that PLCS/Oasis have decided to use the technique of "classification" to replace the use of many id &amp; role attributes of the PLCS model, should this information be placed within the annex on Implementation method specific requirements. This would be logical since there already exists advice on the representation of empty strings and the like.</p>

Given that PLCS/Oasis have decided to implement at the ARM level rather than the MIM, should this not also be added in the Implementation annex? At least to say that an ARM implementation should be considered for conformance?</p>

  That is the title of that which is being mapped in the mapping clause. This may well be an attribute.
