<idef0 application_protocol="systems_engineering">
  <!-- view point of the IDEF0 model -->
  <viewpoint>systems engineering.  This viewpoint captured in the IDEF0 digrams presented has been derived 
  from many of the widely used systems engineering process standards existing and under development in the year 2000. 
  This model is biased towards the need to both show support for a generic systems engineering process model while also highlighting 
  the associated needs of an associated information model.  The following paragraphs hyperlink IDEF0 activity to the
  Ap233 implementation module that is the root for relevant information modelling capability.
