    <p><b>What systems engineering is</b></p>

   <p>Systems Engineering is <i>An interdisciplinary collaborative approach to derive, evolve, 
   and verify a life cycle balanced system solution that satisfies customer expectations and 
   meets public acceptability.</i> (IEEE 1220-1984) </p>

   <p><i>Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization 
   of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early 
   in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and 
   system validation while considering the complete problem.</i> (INCOSE)</p>

   <p>The complete problem spans:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>stakeholder needs;</li>
   <li>requirements;</li>
   <li>the enterprise and competitors;</li>
   <li>concept;</li>
   <li>design;</li>
   <li>design optimization by trade studies;</li>
   <li>design validation and verification;</li>
   <li>manufacture;</li>
   <li>product validation and verification;</li>
   <li>test;</li>
   <li>maintenance;</li>
   <li>disposal;</li>
   <li>training and support;</li>
   <li>cost and schedule;</li>
   <li>program management.</li>
   </ul>

   <p><i>Systems Engineering integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort 
   forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. 
   Systems Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with 
   the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs.</i> (INCOSE)</p>
   
   <p>Systems Engineering makes extensive use of specification of all interfaces, performance 
   analysis, and trade studies to ensure that the system is near optimal for and will be accepted 
   by stakeholders and the marketplace. It is applicable to anything for which a well defined 
   boundary can be established whether mechanical, electrical, electronic, information, chemical, 
   biological, social or organizational.</p>
   
   <p><b>What Ap233 is</b></p>
   
   <p>Ap233 is an information model that captures the concepts used in Systems Engineering, as 
   <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:se1:1">Figure 1</clause_ref> shows. 
   These concepts may be represented by a variety of symbols and each set of such 
   symbols can be combined into an number of different views. A particular set of symbols and views 
   constitutes a language. Tools automate the use of such a language to represent and model systems. 
   For any language a number of different tools may exist and they may not be able to exchange data 
   even using the same language unless they have compatible schema for storing that language. Thus a 
   single set of concepts results in a plethora of languages and tools.</p>

		<figure id="se1" number="1"> 
		<title>AP233 Information model</title>
			<img src="Slide9.gif"/>	
		</figure>

		
    <p>The tools are used by engineers. Frequently it is the organization that establishes the process, 
    a specification of the views and development order that shall be followed, that the engineers 
    shall follow. Two organizations using the same tool may or may not use equivalent views in doing 
    their work.</p>

    <p>In general there is no single tool that can support all the work that must be done so the 
    tools are most efficient when put in an environment that enables them to exchange the information 
    artifacts that the engineers produce using the tools. Often different tools incorporated in a 
    single environment cannot exchange information. Very often the organizations in a supply chain 
    or working together on a single project as a consortium will have different environments 
    incorporating different sets of tools. Yet all members of the supply chain or consortium need 
    to efficiently share data rigorously and at low cost.</p>

    <p>The application protocol, like AP233 for Systems Engineering, provides a solution to this 
    problem. Each tool needs an interface that interconnects the tool with the AP. The interface 
    transforms the data artifacts from the tool for correct storage in the AP and transforms data 
    supplied by the AP for use by the tool.</p>

    <p>In this way AP233 supports information exchange among organizations even though their 
    environments contain different tools.  AP233 is the glue for organizations working together 
    in a consortium or a supplier chain.</p>
    
   <p><b>What Ap233 contains</b></p>
   
   <p><clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:se2:2">Figure 2</clause_ref> 
   shows the basic capabilities of AP233. It is divided into two main parts, Program 
   Management and System Requirements/Design. Major capabilities are listed in each box. The 
   relevant kinds of tools that are applicable surround each box. The two main parts of the work 
   are interconnected by risk analysis, issue resolution, and management authorization and review. 
   Where these capabilities share concepts, i.e. where they are semantically equivalent, there can 
   be exchange of information artifacts among any of the tools through the tool interfaces and the 
   AP233 information model.</p>


		<figure id="se2" number="2"> 
		<title>AP233 content and associated tools</title>
		<img src="Slide10.gif"/>	
		</figure>

   <p>The same transfer is possible where there is semantic identity with downstream design, 
   manufacture, test, and maintenance tools. There are many ISO 10303 Application Protocols 
   (AP’s) for a variety of industrial businesses such as, geometry, circuit board and chip 
   development, ship building, building construction, furniture design and manufacture, maintenance, 
   etc.  A large number of different tools are used by these businesses and interface through their 
   own AP’s. All of these AP’s have been made modular and share, as much as possible, the same modules 
   This approach is vital for connecting systems engineering tools to downstream tools and it makes 
   possible the use of AP233 as an integrating AP across all the others.</p>

   <p>The shared modularity has also required that the AP233 modules use naming conventions that 
   were developed a decade or more ago by developers in other disciplines. The consequence is that 
   AP233 contains names in the detailed EXPRESS code that will seem foreign to practicing systems 
   engineers. It also means that many modules will use a different common module for widely needed 
   representation of entities like number or a weighting factor. Thus the reader who looks at a 
   particular module may not see there an entity that he knows belongs there because it resides 
   in a shared module and is connected to the module he is reading. Efficient use of the EXPRESS 
   language also means that the connection to the common module may go through a chain of classes 
   and subclasses; it may be very indirect for the reader. </p>

   <p>For the reasons above, this introduction does not attempt to show the reader the details of 
   the EXPRESS code. Rather this introduction attempts to: </p>
	<ol>
	<li>describe AP233 as a container of concepts shared by tools; </li>
	<li>list number of the Ap233 capabilities; </li>
	<li>show kinds of tools that can interface with one another through AP233;</li>
	<li>show the major mappings of capabilities onto the modules that constitute the information module.</li>
	</ol>

   <p>Those who wish to investigate the modules in detail can use this Introduction as a guide to 
   that adventure. 
   <clause_ref linkend="purpose:figure:se3:3">Figure 3</clause_ref>
   shows a top-level view of the module hierarchy. It is important to be 
   aware that the boxes under a higher box do not necessarily completely compose it. Rather there 
   may be additional things in the box above. This is not intuitive to those accustomed to hardware 
   development, but it is a result of the software languages.</p>

   		<figure id="se3" number="3"> 
		<title>Top-level hierarchy of AP233 modules</title>

		</figure>

   <p>The capabilities of Figure 2. map into modules of Figure 3. as identified below. Be 
   aware that these are not leaf cell modules. There may be structure below them, and they may 
   connect to modules above and below through type extensions. This makes reading the code or 
   the graphic EXPRESS-G diagrams difficult, but it is the nature of the language. </p>

     that which is discernable by the reproducible measurement of its characteristics
     <note>The semantic term element includes matter, energy and information.  The term 
     product from ISO 10303-Part 1 STEP definitions defines product as: a thing or 
     substance produced by a natural or artificial process. This part of ISO 10303 
     needs to define the informational attributes associated with the entity named 
     "product" as defined within ISO 10303-1017 - Product Identification. This entity 
     has attributes that enable one to capture: id, name and description.  ISO 10303-1017 
     provides the definition: A Product is the identification of a product or of a type 
     of product. It is a collector of data common to all revisions of the product. Element 
     appears to be a legitimate subclass of product because this part requires reproducible 
     measurement of element.</note>
     <example>Any thing from microscopic particles to galaxy clusters is an element.  
     Any thing with a finite existence from galaxies with billion-year lives to trans-uranic 
     elements with lifetimes less than nano-seconds. Counter-example: Things like ghosts, 
     devils, the Loch Ness monster, the city of Atlantis are not discernable by reproducible 
     measurement and are excluded. Research and development things that do not yet have 
     reproducible measurements and process control are excluded. For example, silicon for 
     electronic devices would be excluded in 1900. </example>

     categories provide the grouping of elements into a set based on defined 
     properties that serve as selection criteria for which elements of all those
     in the universe belong in that set
     <note>This is one of the forms of generalization/specialization. This is 
     <b>not inheritance</b> as used in object-oriented software languages. Physical 
     elements of matter and energy do not inherit their properties. Rather they posses 
     the properties of themselves and can be identified by measurement of those properties.</note>
     
     <example>Explanation: It is categorization that enables us to define alternatives 
     and create taxonomies for libraries. </example>
     <ul>
     <li>Inclusive/Complete Category: Any Element of the super category may 
     reside in any number of the sub-categories and all members of the super-category 
     are members of at least one of the sub-categories.</li></ul>
     <example>the super category is all apples raised on a particular farm. The subcategories 
     are used for sorting and include: good apples, bruised apples, marked apples, rotten 
     apples, and wormy apples.</example>
     <ul>
     <li>Inclusive/Incomplete Category: Any Element of the super category may reside in any 
     number of the sub-categories and only some members of the super-category are members

     <example>the super category is all fruit raised on a particular farm. The subcategories 
     are used for sorting and include: good apples, bruised apples, marked apples, rotten

     <ul>
     <li>Exclusive/Complete Category:  Any Element of the super-category may reside in one 
     and only one of the sub-categories and all members of the super-category are members 
     of at least one of the sub-categories.</li></ul>
     <example>An automobile has in its decomposition tree an engine. For this automobile 
     any of three engines: 140 HP, 180 HP, and 220 HP. The superclass of engine is exhausted 
     by the subclasses and the subclasses are independent.</example>

   These interactions may be highly nonlinear.
   </note>
   <note> Systems decompose hierarchically; they are systems of systems. </note>
   <example>A car has a well defined boundary with respect to its environment, and the

   <example>Elements in the environment need not have well defined boundaries as do systems.  
   A laptop computer can connect to a power grid. But for the design of the laptop it is

 <note>Property is usefully decomposed into several categories – the measurable characteristics

 to separate behavior from structure (function from form) and to allocate behavior to structure 
 based on trade studies among alternatives.
   </note>
   <example>The acceleration of a car is in the first category. behavior.  This characteristic 
   can be observed in the normal operation of the car. The weight of the car is not directly 
   observable in the use of the car.  It requires that the car be placed on a scale to record 
   the measurable characteristic. The fact that a car has four wheels, a steering wheel on

  <note>This is the subclass of property that includes measurable characteristics in normal use. 
  It encompasses the response of the system to excitation by things in its environment. In some 
  other engineering disciplines it is the analysis with differential equations that is called 
  behavior. That is not what is meant here. Here, in AP233, behavior is a model representation 
  of a functional requirement: it is what the system is to do.
   </note>
   <example>Make a fender is a behavior with several function steps, inputs of sheet steel, 
   power, paint primer, paint and the output of a fender. Ring is the behavior of a bell or

   <def>what an element exhibits or does not exhibit in response to excitation and

   <note>This is the subclass of property that encompasses measurable characteristics that 
   require additional instrumentation to measure them. They cannot be established from responses 
   to the environment alone. All of the "properties" used in analysis with differential 
   equations fall into this category.
   </note>
   <example>Responses of an element like mass, power consumption, mean time between failure, 
   etc. are critically important and appear in requirements. They are not measured by responses

   <term id="ap233_structure">structure</term>
   <def>the decomposition, interconnection and other static relationship among the parts of the system
   <note>Physical properties are budgeted to structure using analysis methods, and the emergent 
   performance is calculated using the same methods. Behavior is allocated to the structure. Form 
   and function are separated conceptually so that the design can be optimized by considering 
   several different structures that can provide the desired emergent behavior and properties.
   </note>
   <example>In a real example of optimization the engineer examines not just the maximum or minimum, 
   but looks at the trend in data in that region to be sure the solution is robust. That is, the 
   design solution must not degrade rapidly with small variances in the variables of design.

   <note>Link must be provided in the concept model because a number of application tools use the 
   concept. Links ultimately are fully specified and become a system-assembly.
   </note>
   <example>In a pumping system it may be useful to define the pumps and tanks while representing the 
   piping as links without detail. At some point in the design detail like diameter, flow impedance, 
   pressure rating, and corrosion resistance must be defined. At his point the link becomes a part.

   <term id="ap233_port">port</term>
   <def>a connection point on a part in the part decomposition hierarchy
   <note>Systems interconnect with one another port-to-port. Ports couple to desired things 
   in the environment and also to the ports of things that cause failure, threaten security 
   or safety. The alias for port is interface connection, this is the term that is used in AP239. </note>
   <note>When a system interacts with its environment, the boundary between the system and 
   the environment is the collection of all interacting ports.
   </note>
   <example>Consider a ultrasonic transmitting transducer coupled to a water tank and a receiver 
   transducer coupled to the tank. The transmitter port connects to a water port and couples 
   sound energy into the water. The intensity at any point is a result of the impedance match 
   between the two ports, the radiation pattern of the transducer, and the attenuation and 
   dispersion in the water. The receiving transducer is attached to another port of the water. 
   The received signal is dependant on the relative impedance of the two ports, the sound 
   distribution in the water, and the radiation pattern of the receiving transducer. This example 
   is often oversimplified as "broadcast" neglecting the port to port conditions and the properties 
   of the medium and neglecting the ports.

   <term id="ap233_interconnection">interconnection</term>
   <def>a listing of the ports that interconnect with one another
   <note>The interconnection may exist for structural reasons without any flow from port to port. 
   The interconnection may exist because functions are assigned to particular assemblies, and the 
   output from one function is an input to the other function. In this case the ports and their 
   interconnection must exist to support flow. The alias for interconnection is interface 
   connection, the term used in AP239.

   <term id="ap233_interface specification">interface specification</term>
   <def> a description of a port of a part that includes the geometric description, input/output 
   description, protocols that must be met, assemblies of parts required to join two ports, 
   allowable defect characteristics, etc. including the emergent properties of the interface 
   that are the result of the two ports interacting, and are not associated with either
  <note>Parts interact physically through direct physical contact, exchange of elements, and 
  through forces they exert such as gravity, compression or torque. Thus input/output is bound 
  to ports and described by interfaces. The interface may consist of more than the two ports 
  and may involve an assembly of parts as in the case of two flanges that are assembled with 
  six bolts and an O-ring. The interface may also require detailed description to define what 
  occurs there or how it is maintained. 
   </note>
   <example>For two ports to connect, their interfaces must be compatible. The current carrying 
   capacity of a plug and a socket is a result of the surface area of contact, the contact 
   force, the wiping action on plugging them together, and the surface conductivity of both. 
   This is an emergent property that is not assignable to either port individually.

   <term id="ap233_function">function</term>
   <def>the entity in the context of modeling that transforms an input set of elements 
   into a set of output elements that may be the same or measurably different from the input set
   <note>It is a part of behavior. This is what functions do in mathematics where the 
   input/output are variables. In software the input/output is data. In systems engineering 
   the input/output are elements, matter, energy, and information. An internal function is a 
   kind of function that is allocated to and implemented by the system/structure. An external 
   function is a kind of function that is allocated to and implemented by elements in the environment. 
   </note>
   <example>The function may be "burn gasses" with an input of two moles of hydrogen and one 
   mole of oxygen. The output will be one mole of water, distinctly different from the inputs 
   and a lot of energy. This function may be followed by a function "cool to 90 degrees 
   centigrade". The input had pressure and volume proportional to temperature; the output 
   is now liquid with a well-defined volume, an isotropic compressibility and a viscosity. If 
   the next function is "cool to –10 degrees centigrade", then the viscosity goes away and the 
   compressibility becomes a fourth rank tensor relating stress to strain.

<definition>
   <term id="ap233_input output">input output</term>
   <def>elements consumed by a function are inputs and those generated by a function are outputs
 <note>The name input/output or I/O is used because a given I/O entity is generated by one 
 function and consumed by another. It is a part of behavior. In the general case outputs are 
 different things than inputs, and physical properties, behaviors, values, variances and 
 probability distributions can all change. In this general definition "function" is an element 
 of type information and cannot be realized in the physical world except through elements of 
 type matter or energy that exhibit that function. In the physical world things transform other 
 things. It is this fact of reality that results in the allocation of function to structure 
 which is really a statement that this particular structure entity exhibits this particular 
 function and it will be used to provide that transformation. The thought pattern is to think 
 of the desired transformation, function, to consider alternative things that might be used to 
 provide it, and to select among these, using a trade study based on optimization.</note>
   <example>I/O may trigger functions and it may terminate functions.</example>

   <term id="ap233_function ordering">function ordering</term>
   <def>imposes how/when functions execute, which may be sequential, concurrent, traversed 
   iteratively, or lie on separate alternative path
  <note>David <b>some word-smithing has been done, please check</b> </note>
   <note>It is a part of behavior. There are several ways to represent function ordering. It 
   may be done with ordering operators and triggering input/output as in classical behavior 
   diagrams or it may be done with events, states, and transitions as done in state machines 
   and state charts. For this fine level of detail it is necessary to inter-compare the 
   detailed models in SEDRES with those in the concept model and those emerging from UML 2.0 development.
   </note>
   <example>A function is activated when all preceding threads of functions are complete. 
   At this point the function examines its inputs. If all triggering inputs are present the 
   function proceeds to do its work. If one or more triggering inputs is absent, the function 
   waits for them before doing its work. Triggers that arrive while the functions are running 
   are stored in a first in first out queue. Ordinary input/output that arrives while a function 
   is deactivated is stored in a last in first out queue. If the function is running it is 
   discarded.  A function is deactivated when it completes its work or is deactivated by input/output.</example>

   <example>A requirement may state that a space probe shall weigh no more than 150 pounds. 
   In that case the masses of the subsystems must add up to no more than 150 pounds. It is best

   <example>As the designers do their work they arrive at design values for the parts. 
   These values will generally differ from the budgeted values because the designers have 
   detailed information unavailable before. It is necessary to calculate the properties of 
   the whole based on these design values to ensure that requirements are satisfied by the

   is necessary to carry along temporary property values to accomplish the design work.</note>
   <example>A designer may have been budgeted 40 pounds for his subsystem. He may find 
   a design solution that weighs 38 pounds. In the design process he may consider 
   alternatives that turn out to weigh 36 , 38,  41, and 43 pounds. These are temporary

   <example>A part like a turbine blade has a number of important properties critical to 
   the performance of a jet engine, These include aerodynamic efficiency, weight, moment

		<description>
			<p>These 2 data planning figures, as used in the <b>What Ap233 contains</b> section of the   
			<clause_ref linkend="purpose"/> provide the bridge between the business of 
			systems engineering as enabled by its software support tools and the Ap233 
			information model.</p>
			
			<p>The methodology used to build the Ap233 information model in a hierarchal manner while 
			also enabling the networking of capabilities necessary to capture the complexities of systems 
			engineering follows.</p>
			
			<p>Both the business of systems engineering and its Ap233 information model are complex.
			This leads to the problem of complexity presentation. It is done herein by first 
			partitioning the problem into two parts; Implementation modules and step enabled concepts.</p>
			
			<p><b>Implementation modules</b></p>
			
			<p>Implementation modules service focused business needs.  Ap233 arranges these 
			in a hierarchal manner as shown in the data planning model; thus enabling capabilities 
			of greater scope to be build from capabilities of lesser scope.  As capabilities are joined in the 
			hierarchy there is a need to network their respective standalone capabilities together.  Networking  
			results in a new capability greater than the disjoint union. Networking is accomplished 
			via the EXPRESS modeling language capability referred to as "extensible selects". In a very loose 
			sense this enables a publish and subscribe capability between capabilities created (published) 
			and other capabilities with a need to use (subscribe).</p>
			
			<p><b>Step enabled concepts</b></p>
			
			<p>Ap233 is build in a modular manner from a repository of a large number of foundational and dilated STEP 
			modeling capabilities shared by all ISO 10303 application protocols.  To provide some visibility
			into this complexity problem a set of high level natural language concepts; for example: who, when, 
			where, what, etc. are defined.  These enable one to group all of the modules used by Ap233 relative 
			to easily visualized and reasonably disjoint concepts.  
			The full set of concepts defined and associated groupings are presented graphically in 
			<module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide">ISO 10303-433 Annex F</module_ref>.
			The ability to now view Ap233 complexity relative to a few implementation modules 
			and STEP capability enabled concepts is created.  It is important to note 
			that the groupings and associated membership boundaries are fuzzy.  This is intentional.  The 
			groupings are used simply as a complexity visualization aid.</p>
			
			<p><b>Complexity presentation</b></p>
			
			<p>The following subclauses provide a top-level graphical view of the simple statement that 
			<b>Extensible selects network modules together to realize implementation modules</b>.  In each 
			graphical display extensible selects and modules are grouped relative to the named concepts. Associated 
			text provides hyperlinks to the clauses within the modules where relevant detail is found.		
			</p>
			
			<p><b>A matrix analysis view of the complexity problem</b></p>
			
			<p>Concept groupings can be graphically presented as 
			"Concept maps", see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map"/>.  The maps can be designed to show 
			both module to module connectivity and where extensible select types are defined.  All concept maps are 
			collected together in 
			<module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide">ISO 10303-433 Annex F</module_ref>.</p>
			
			<p>Readers with a mathematics background find that cluster analysis via matrix row/column operations 
			provides good visualization insight and uncovers hidden logic based patterns. It can also expose 
			obvious errors.  <clause_ref linkend="inforeqt:figure:imcm">Figure 4-1</clause_ref> provides a module 
			"uses" vs. module "used by" matrix at the implementation module plus concept group level of granularity.</p>
			
			<p>Modules within a row index module group use modules within the <b>X</b> flagged column module groups. 
			Some readers may find this a useful aid into data model visualization. It is applied within 
			the documentation as an explanation aid. 
			</p>
			
			<note>Recall from matrix analysis that the null matrix implies no relationship between associated 
			row/column elements, upper triangular implies a hierarchal relationship between the associated set 
			of row - column elements and a populated non-symmetric matrix implies a network of relationships. 
			A bit more insight can be derived from linear analysis.  The eigenvalues of an upper triangular matrix 
			are guaranteed to be real and well-conditioned while eigenvalues for a non-symmetric are complex 
			and may be ill-conditioned.  Furthermore, non-symmetric matrices can be singular implying a non-unique 
			inverse relationship.  It is not hard to be convinced that the complexity of dealing with non-symmetric 
			numeric matrices will carry over to analogous information model realization difficulties when networked 
			relationships exist.</note>

<annex_clause title="Ap233's technical foundation - background">
  
<p>This part of ISO 10303 had its origins with Esprit Project 20496 - SEDRES Systems Engineering 
Data Representation and Exchange Standardisation.  The project was completed with the publication of 
ISO PAS 20542.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter the need for extension was recognized. The model itself needed to be made consistent 
with the modular structure evolving within the ISO 10303 community and its scope needed to be extended to 
support the needs and associated process standards of the systems engineering community; as represented by ISO, 
OMG (Object Management Group) and INCOSE(International Council on Systems Engineering). 
See <a href="http://www.incose.org/practice/standardsupdate.aspx"/></p>

<p>The need to harmonize associated requirements, viewpoints and semantics across this expanded group of 
stakeholders lead to the creation of a conceptual base.  This had the net effect of both documenting consensus 
building agreements and providing a framework by which semantic consistency could be checked as the conceptual 
base evolved. This "Concept model" and its companion "Semantic dictionary" are provided in the following 
sections of this Annex. 
</p>

<p>These two interwoven elements of Ap233's conceptual base have been extensively reviewed by the 
ISO AP233 development team, along with members of INCOSE and OMG.  The work was performed via the leadership 
efforts of INCOSE's Model Driven Design working group <a href="http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/wg/mdsd/"/>.  
This group has, in its efforts to extend best practices of systems engineering into software engineering also succeed 
in initiating the SysML project within the OMG and assisting with that activity. The home page for the SysML 
partners is <a href="http://www.sysml.org"/>; also see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SysML"/>. 
</p>

<p>Additionally significant inputs to Ap233's behaviour modeling capabilities and Ap233-SysML consistency needs 
came in via work done to insure Ap233 harmonization with the U.S Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF), 
see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Architecture_Framework"/>.</p>

<p>As Ap233 was evolving to support systems engineering within the STEP community a parallel 
<module_ref linkend="ap239_product_life_cycle_support:introduction"/> effort began.  As these efforts proceeded 
in an organizationally independent manner, respective stakeholder and developer groups both mixed together and worked 
hard to insure harmonization.  Both capabilities share a common set of STEP foundation modules.  In fact, about 70% 
of the modules used by Ap233 are also 
used by Ap239.</p>
<p>During the early years of the Ap239 effort it was recognized they an ability to accommodate a wide range of 
semantic standards was required.  This lead to the use of reference data and eventually this was 
supported by the ontology standards evolving within the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) community; namely 
OWL (Web Ontology Language).  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language"/>.  Examples of reference data
and its use within the OASIS PLCS group can be found at <a href="http://www.plcs-resources.org/plcs/dexlib/dex_index.htm"/>.
It would be safe to assume that the Ap233 development team fully intends to remain harmonized with Ap239 as our respective uses of 
reference data, taxonomies and ontologies mature.

<annex_clause title="Concept model for systems engineering">
<p>This annex provides the concept model for systems engineering that was the foundation for 
developing this part of ISO 10303.  Together with the terms defined in 
clause <clause_ref linkend="definition:Application activity model">3</clause_ref> of this part, 
this model defines the breath and scope of capability while also providing the semantic reference 
base and model based requirements that were used to drive development of this part of ISO 10303.</p>
 
<p>Definitions used stem from numerous authoritative sources; such as: ISO15288, INCOSE SE Handbook, 
NASA SE Handbook, etc. However; these could not be used verbatim since, when used together without change, 
they became circular and inconsistent.  Circularity  and inconsistency problems were removed by the 
consensus agreement of Ap233's ISO, INCOSE, OMG systems engineering expert team.
</p>

<p>The definitions in clause 3 explain meanings in natural language. The model captures the 
multitude of relationships in a graphic form so that the relationships can be scanned. 
Figure <clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug13"> K-1</clause_ref> provides a guide for interpreting the 
models presented in this annex.    
</p>

<annex_clause title="Top-level model">
<p>The model defined in figure <clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug1"> K-2</clause_ref>
is patterned after UML 1, with indications of semantics that are missing from the language.
The model needs to be read with reference to the definitions in the semantic dictionary. It 
starts with Element that is any thing on which repeated measurements can be made for the 
engineering purposes of interest. This is  a necessary definition because otherwise it is not 
possible to verify that a design or implementation meets its requirements. Element is built from 
Element in a hierarchy. The aggregation symbol has a small "C" in it to show that what is meant 
is a decomposition into all of the parts. The special notation is used because this concept is
missing from UML 1.</p>
		
		<figure id="ug1" number="K-2"> 
		<title>Top-level concept model</title>
		<img src="ug_figure1.png"/>	
		</figure>
 
<p>The Domain of Interest constitutes all the things of interest to the application.</p>

<p>System is a kind of Element and thus it is built of systems in a hierarchy and it must have 
measurable characteristics that are repeatable. What makes the System unique is that it has well 
defined relationships with all of the things with which it interacts. The collection of those 
things is its Environment. To have a system it is necessary to characterize what is in the 
system and what is in the environment along with the static and dynamic interactions between 
system and environment. The Environment contains Elements and Systems.</p>
<p>
Different persons in engineering, manufacturing, maintenance, and management need different 
sets of information about the system. Manufacturing personnel need to know about all the 
materials, nuts and rivets that go into the system and how they assemble together. Maintenance 
personnel need to have diagnostic information and deal with replaceable units of the system. 
There are a very large number of such useful collections of information, each with its own 
context.  System View provides for the collection of such sets of information, each set in a 
particular context.</p>
<p>
An important subset of things in the environment is the Stakeholders. These are all the persons 
and organizations with a need, preference, or interest in the system. Stakeholders may include 
manufacturer, owner, user of owner's services, user of the system, operator, maintainer, 
government regulator. Stakeholder Need represents their need, preference, interest, etc. 
in the system. If the System is designed and implemented well, then it satisfies these needs 
in a manner that is superior to competitive systems. It sells in the marketplace.</p>
<p>
A Property is a named measurable or observable attribute, quality or  characteristic of an 
se_thing. If you can measure it or observe it is called a property. Properties have units, 
values, variances and probability distributions associated with them.  They may be looked up 
in handbooks of properties of standard materials, they may be calculated from the structure 
of the thing, or they may be measured directly. In general they are tensors and may be a 
function of time. Because of the multiple ways of arriving at a property and its values, 
it is important to have a Reference Document that establishes the source of the information.</p>
<p>
A Requirement is a statement of a Property that a System shall exhibit.  The relationship to 
System is handled by allocating the requirement to the system that shall exhibit that property. 
This formality allows the engineer to consider alternative allocations to different systems 
that may fulfill the requirement. It is fundamental to trade-off among solutions. Requirements 
originate from Stakeholder Needs. As the design proceeds in levels of detail, requirements are 
derived from other requirements. These "derived from" relationships are preserved as traceability 
relationships. In a real world problem requirements will be changed from time to time. It is 
critical to trace from a requirement that has changed to other requirements impacted by that change.</p>
<p>
It is useful to distinguish among three kinds of properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Structure</b> the description of how a system decomposes into its parts and how the 
parts assemble to make the whole.</li>
<li>
<b>Behavior</b> what the system does in response to the things in its environment. This 
includes both desired responses that satisfy needs, and prevention of undesired responses 
(failures) that can cause injury, destruction, or loss.</li>
<li>
<b>Physical Property</b> includes all the measurable or observable attributes, qualities or 
characteristic of an Element that cannot be observed in interaction with the environment. 
Additional instruments or tools are required to make the measurement or observation. Mass 
may require a scale for weighing, index of refraction may require use of an optical instrument.</li></ul>
<p>
These three kinds of properties are described separately and then interrelated. This 
principle supports the consideration of alternatives

<annex_clause title="System static structure">
<p>Figure <clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug2"> K-3</clause_ref> provides a graphical 
depiction of the system's static structure. Structure is built from Part, Port, and Interface 
Specification. Structure decomposes  hierarchically. This forces Part and Port to also 
decompose hierarchically. </p>
		<figure id="ug2" number="K-3"> 
		<title>System static structure</title>
		<img src="ug_figure2.png"/>	
</figure>

<p>
The Part is simply a part or component list. The name used  follows the STEP manufacturing 
point of view of looking at a part or component and talking about it as an assembly because 
their job is to assemble it.</p>
<p>
Each Part (part or component) attaches to others at particular locations. These locations are 
called Ports. This is a familiar idea when one thinks of the port on a power cord that plugs 
into a port on the wall to get electric power. It also applies to the surface of a bridge, a 
port, that interacts with wind, is a port. In the second case the concept is less intuitive and 
more formal. Ports connect to ports.</p>
<p>
Interconnection specifies which ports attach to which other ports. Together Part, Port, and 
Interconnection specify how parts go together to constitute the whole. This description 
does not include Behavior or Physical Properties.
</p>
<p>
Each port has associated with it a description, an Interface Specification, that describes 
the geometry, forces, transferred material or energy or information, protocols, how to 
assemble to it, and tests that may be required of the port-to-port connection. For two 
ports to be interconnected  their interfaces must be compatible.

<annex_clause title="Structure, behavior and physical property">
<p>
Structure, Behavior and Physical Properties are described separately. Behavior and Physical 
Properties are allocated or budgeted to Part to complete the description.
</p>
<p>
Behavior is built from Function, I/O (Input/Output), and Function Ordering as shown in 
figure <clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug3"> K-4</clause_ref>. Any Element may 
be I/O (Light blue shows an entity comes from figure 
<clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug1"> K-2</clause_ref>). A 
Function is an entity of transformation that changes a set of inputs to a set of outputs. 
Function Ordering orders the functions such that it is possible to represent sequence, 
concurrency, branching, and iteration.
</p>
<p>
There are two major forms of representing Behavior. Function based behavior, independent 
of state, emerged in systems engineering in the 1970's. It provides for completed functions 
to enable succeeding functions, for I/O to trigger functions, and for ordering operators 
to represent sequence, branching, and iteration. The SEDRES model represents this with a 
Petrie net model. UML 2.0 contributors may be using a Petrie Net model. If so, then these 
two models need careful comparison.

<annex_clause title="Description function based behavior">
<p>
A model for Function Based Behavior is given in figure 
<clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug12"> K-4</clause_ref>. I/O may trigger functions, 
starting or terminating functions. I/O that triggers is coupled to the function by 
binding to a Function Control Port. I/O that does not trigger is bound to a Regular 
Function Port. I/O arriving while a function is active is stored in a queue unless 
it is terminating I/O.
</p>
<p>
Function ordering uses a set of operators: AND to define concurrency, Multi-exit 
Function or OR to represent alternative paths, a sequence operator, and LOOP, Iterate, 
and Replicate constructs. LOOP and ITERATE require limits to control their termination. 
Scripts are used to provide detailed control of function ordering. Probabilities are 
assigned to Or Out to facilitate execution of the behavior to produce time lines or 
Monte Carlo simulation.
</p>
<p>

	<annex_clause title="Resource">
<p>
Resource is: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of input available to a function or the amount of output available from it;</li>
<li> or the amount of property of a system available to a function.</li>
</ul>
<example>There exists some number of missiles available to a missile battery available 
for the function "Shoot".</example>

The function "transmit message" may be allocated to a satellite system, a fiber optic 
line, a microwave link, etc. Each of these alternatives has some value of the property 
"bandwidth" that may be used by the function.</example>

Function - Resource Relationships
</p>
<p>
Captures: Captures indicates the resource that this object requires (but does not destroy) 
during execution. Resources are captured when the execution of the function begins and 
released when the function completes execution.  
</p>
<p>
Consumes: Consumes indicates the resource that this object requires (and destroys) during 
execution. Resources are consumed when the execution of the function begins. 
</p>
<p>
Produces: Produces indicate the resource that is generated by the function. Resources are 
produced when the execution of the function completes.

<annex_clause title="Function activation rules">
<p>
The representative set of activation rules are shown in figure 
<clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug4"> K-5</clause_ref> are defined as follows:
</p>
	<figure id="ug4" number="K-5"> 
	<title>Function based behavior</title>
	<img src="ug_figure4.png"/>	
	</figure>
<p>
Start Rule - A function is activated and begins its work if and only if all preceding 
functions and threads of functions have completed and all inputs that trigger the 
function are present at the function control ports. A function begins work if and only 
all resources to be utilized by that function are available. Otherwise it waits.
</p>
<p>
Run Rule -  Trigger signals received while a function is active are stored in queues. 
</p>
<p>
Terminate Rule - Functions complete generation of all their outputs, terminate, and 
pass activation to the next function when the time interval allocated to them expires. 
Functions complete production of all resources and return any resources that were 
captured during execution.</p>
<p>
I/O Queuing Rules
</p>
<p>
A representative set of queuing rules follows:
</p>
<p>
Triggering I/O that arrives at function is stored in a FIFO queue. On its next activation 
the function uses the I/O first stored in the queue. 
</p>
<p>Non-trigger signals received while a function is active are discarded. Non-trigger 
signals received while a function is dormant are stored in    LIFO queues. It is the 
last I/O received that is used.
</p>
<p>

The Function Exit Construct
</p>
<p>
A Function Exit construct links a functional decomposition to the exit paths identified 
for the parent function. For example, assume you have a Multi-exit Function with two exit 
paths. If this is the leaf-level of your model, scripting (or probabilities if no script 
is defined) selects which path to take.
</p>
<p>
However, if this function is decomposed, there are Function Exit constructs corresponding 
to the two exit paths in the higher-level function. When one of the Exit constructs is 
encountered, execution of the decomposition is complete and control is passed to the 
corresponding exit path at the higher level.
</p>
<p>
State based behavior emerged from automata theory and has matured into State Charts that 
provide for state explosion in highly concurrent models. SEDRES has a representation for 
this and has demonstrated model transfer between Statemate and Teamwork Real Time tools.
</p><p>
In the UML community Action Semantics are to provide a basis for state based behavior. 
These two approaches require careful correlation. The concept model here does not go 
beyond the very general notion of function ordering, but notes the critical importance 
of correlation among emerging detailed models.</p>

<p>
System Assemblies in the Part tree all have Physical Properties such as mass, power 
consumption, geometry, MTBF, drag coefficient, etc. The Physical Properties are assigned 
to a particular Part. A Physical Property has a name and an ID that identifies it 
uniquely. For example, many different System Assemblies have the Physical Property mass. 
Consequently each of these assigned Physical Properties needs an ID. Each has an 
associated unit in which it is measured.
</p>
<p>
A Physical Property assigned to a particular Part has values. The value may be expressed 
as a mean, a mean with variance, a probability distribution, or a histogram. All of these 
values are a result of a set of measurements and analysis of the data. The value goes 
through a series of versions as the system definition evolves. The Part is declared to 
have a Required or Budgeted Value.  The Part may have a Target Budget Property Value 
used as a guide or target as designers consider alternatives. A Part, as a whole, may 
have a Calculated Property Value based on analysis of the properties, behaviors and 
interactions of its parts. When a Part is built, it may have a Measured Property Value.

<annex_clause title="Calculated property values - analytical modeling">
<p>
Any one assembly is an interconnection of assemblies one tier down in the tree. The emergent 
properties of any assembly are a result of the properties, interconnection, and interaction of 
the sub-assemblies from which it is built. The relationships may be very non-linear in the 
physical world as observed with phenomena like combustion and friction.
</p>
<p>
 The basic relationships for analytical modeling of emergent properties and budgeting of 
 properties are shown in Figure 5. A set of engineering equations or estimates, analytical  
 models, are used by systems engineers to budget properties to the interacting sub-assemblies 
 as a guide to designers at the lower level. When designs for all of the sub-assemblies are 
 available, their individual properties and interactions are better defined. The same 
 equations are used to calculate the emergent properties of the complete assembly. The 
 fidelity of the calculations increases as the work proceeds.
</p>
<p>
A Part, as a whole, may have a Calculated Property Value based on analysis of the 
properties, behaviors and interactions of its parts. This is accomplished by estimation 
or by an analysis that solves the relevant engineering equations. This makes it necessary 
to represent physical properties as parameters in the equations of the relevant analysis 
model. Model Parameter provides this parameterization. It has an attribute of its of the 
unit of measure applicable to the analysis. This may be different from the unit assigned 
to Physical Property. The reference_document attribute specifies the standard document 
that contains the reference for the Model_parameter. A default value and valid range 
can be specified when needed.
</p>
<p>
Parameter_assignment assigns parameters to model_parameter that in turn is a  parameter 
for analytical_model. Analytical_representation has a set of parameter_assignments and 
is modeled by one or several analytical models. be solved, Analytical _representation. 
The several Analytical_models provide answers at different levels of fidelity and with 
different efforts of computation. AM_port connects the analytical results back to the 
appropriate location in the part hierarchy.

<annex_clause title="Emergent properties and budgeting of properties example"> 
<p>
One may wish to develop a car that can accelerate from zero to sixty  miles per hour 
in 6.5 seconds or less. This is a required emergent property of the car with elements shown in 
figure <clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug6a"> K-7</clause_ref>.  This behavior 
is a result of the power of the drive train, the air resistance of the body, the total 
mass of the car, and the friction of the tires on the road. These parameters are 
inter-related by a second order differential equation.
</p>
<p>
The differential equation is first used to budget target values of mass, power, drag 
coefficient, and tire friction to the appropriate components as targets for the designers. 
When the designs are available with definite property values, the same equations are used 
to calculate the emergent property, time for acceleration from zero to sixty mph for the car.  
</p>
<p>
Note that there may be several distinctly different approaches to the solution of what 
sub-components to use. Thus it is useful for the assembly to have relationships that 
indicate if it is an alternative or is selected as a solution, if it meets requirements, 
and what its regularization function value may be as the basis of selecting a particular 
solution from among the alternatives.

This entity accomplishes a function similar to the parameter assignment part of a

<clause_ref linkend="tech_disc:figure:ug11"> K-15</clause_ref> shows the model for time. 
</p>
<p>
Continuous Time is a dimension along with three spatial dimensions used by science and 
engineering to describe reality-using math. It has no past, present or future.
</p>
<p>
 Present Time recognizes a standard of year, month, week, day, hour, minute, and second to 
 represent past, present, and future. It is the basis of plans and schedules.
</p>
<p>
Time Interval provides a time duration that may be assigned to a task or function to represent 
how long the task will take for completion.
</p>
<p>
 Start Time is a Present Time that states where in Present Time a Time Interval begins.
</p>
<p>
 Stop Time is a Present Time that states where in Present Time a Time Interval ends.
</p>
<p>
Discrete Time is time represented by clock pulses of negligible duration.    In this 
approximation events occur on each clock pulse.
</p>
<p>
Time is one of the most accurately measured quantities that we have. Current accuracy of 
measurement is about one part in 10 -13. Research underway may extend this to 10 -17. 
Many properties now have primary standards based in part on time.

<annex_clause title="Category">.
<p>
The decomposition tree for Part is more than a simple parts tree. At any node one may 
introduce a category of parts. For example, an automobile may have several different engines 
that can be used in the automobile, each providing a different level of economy and performance.
</p>
<p>
Categories are a grouping of elements into a set based on defined properties that serve as 
selection criteria for which elements of all those in the universe belong in that set Explanation: 
It is categorization that enables us to define alternatives and create taxonomies for libraries. 
This is one of the forms of  generalization/specialization. Note that this is NOT INHERITANCE as 
found in object-oriented software languages. Physical elements, matter and energy, do not inherit 
their properties. Rather they posses the properties of themselves and can be identified by 
measurement of those properties. For a discussion of these issues in computer science see the work 
of Barbara Liskov and her CLU language.
</p>
<note>The subcategories may be exclusive or inclusive and the subcategories may exhaust the super 
category or not there are four such possibilities 
</note>
<p>
Category is the basic concept in the physical world to support specialization - generalization.
