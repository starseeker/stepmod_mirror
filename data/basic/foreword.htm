<P>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national

standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally

carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which

a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee.

International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take

part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)

on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.



<p>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives,

Part 3.



<p>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International

Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting.

Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the member bodies

casting a vote.



<p>In other circumstances, particularly when there is an urgent market requirement for such

documents, a technical committee may decide to publish other types of normative document:

<ul>
<li>an ISO Publicly Available Specification (ISO/PAS) represents an agreement between technical

experts in an ISO working group and  is accepted for publication if it is approved by more than 50%

of the members of the parent committee casting a vote;</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>an ISO Technical Specification (ISO/TS) represents an agreement between the members of a

technical committee and is accepted for publication if it is approved by 2/3 of the members of

the committee casting a vote.</li>
</ul>



<p>An ISO/PAS or ISO/TS is reviewed every three years with a view to deciding whether it can be

transformed into an International Standard.</p>
<p>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this part of ISO 10303
 may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all
such patent rights.<p>
