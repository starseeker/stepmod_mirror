<p>ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing products 
throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only for neutral file exchange,
but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases, and as a basis
for archiving.</P>
