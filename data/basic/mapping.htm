<p>This clause contains the mapping table that shows how each UoF and
application entity of this part of ISO 10303 (see 4) maps to one or several
MIM resource constructs. The mapping table is organized in five
columns. The contents of these five columns are: </p> 

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Column 1) Application element: Name of an application
element as it appears in the application entity definition. Application
entity names are written in uppercase. Attribute names are listed after the
application entity to which they belong and are written in lower case. </p>



<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Column 2) MIM element: Name of an MIM element as it
appears in the MIM, the term 'IDENTICAL MAPPING', or the term 'PATH'. MIM
entities are written in lower case. Attribute names of MIM entities are
referred to as &lt;entity name&gt;.&lt;attribute name&gt;. The mapping of
an application element may result in several related MIM elements. Each of
these MIM elements will require a line of its own in the table. The term
'IDENTICAL MAPPING' indicates that both application entities of an
application assertion map to the same MIM element. The term 'PATH'
indicates that the application assertion maps to the entire reference path.
</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Column 3) Source: For those MIM elements that are
interpreted from the integrated resources, this is the number of the
corresponding part of ISO 10303. For those MIM elements that are created
for the purpose of this part of ISO 10303, this is the number of this
part. </p> 

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Column 4) Rules: One or more numbers may be given which
refer to rules that apply to the current MIM element or reference path. For
rules that are derived from relationships between application entities, the
same rule is referred to by the mapping entries of all the involved MIM
elements. The expanded names of the rules are listed after the table. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Column 5) Reference path: To describe fully the mapping
of an application entity, it may be necessary to specify a reference path
through several related MIM elements. The reference path column documents
the role of a MIM element relative to the MIM element in the row succeeding
it. Two or more such related MIM elements define the interpretation of the
integrated resources that satisfies the requirement specified by the
application entity. For each MIM element that has been created for use
within this part of ISO 10303, a reference path up to its supertype from an
integrated resource is specified. </p> 



<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the expression of reference paths and the
relationships between MIM elements, the following notational conventions
apply: </p> 

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>[] : multiple MIM elements or sections of the reference path are
      required to satisfy an information requirement; </li> 

  <li VALUE="1">() : multiple MIM elements or sections of the reference
      path are identified as alternatives within the mapping to satisfy an
      information requirement; </li>
      
  <li>{} : enclosed section constrains the reference path to satisfy an
      information requirement; </li> 

  <li>-&gt; : attribute references the entity or select type given in the
      following row; </li> 

  <li>&lt;- : entity or select type is referenced by the attribute in the
      following row; </li>
      
  <li>[i] : attribute is an aggregation of which a single member is given
      in the following row; </li>

  <li>[n] : attribute is an aggregation of which member n is given in the
      following row; </li>
      
  <li>=&gt; : entity is a supertype of the entity given in the following
      row; </li> 

  <li>&lt;= : entity is a subtype of the entity given in the following row;
  </li> 
</ol>



<ol START="10" TYPE="a">
  <li>= : the string, select or enumeration type is constrained to a choice
      or value; </li> 

  <li VALUE="1">\ : the line continuation for strings that wrap.</li>
</ol>
