         This part of ISO 10303 specifies a business object model document for ISO 10303-242,
         
         managed model-based 3d engineering.
         The information model of this part of ISO 10303 is less granular than the ARM of ISO
         10303-242 and is, 
         therefore, better suited for communication with and understandability by experts of
         the aerospace, defense and automotive domains. 
         It comprises Business Objects that represent major concepts and information requirements
         of a subset of ISO 10303-242, 
         model-based 3d engineering. 
         It uses the vocabulary of the STEP modules where this vocabulary reflects the terminology
         of the domain experts;
         otherwise, new vocabulary is introduced. 
         The relationship between the business object model and the ARM of ISO 10303-242 is
         explained in this part of ISO 10303. 
         A technical discussion of the business object model is contained in Annex H of ISO
         10303-242.

         Business object model capabilities summary
         
         The product data management concepts of the business object model are distributed
         over several capabilities. The figure below illustrates the relationships among these
         concepts.
         
         Business object model PDM concepts
         
         
         
         The Activities capability represents information concerning the management of activities.
         
         The capability allows the representation of activities and their associated methods.
           
         
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         
         ;;;;.          
         
         
         This capability represents the product and activity management information approval,
         contract, project and alias.
         These concepts are defined and their assignment to product and activity data is specified.
         Various types of relationships are provided among approvals and among projects.
         
         
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         
         ;;;;;;;;.
         
         
         This capability enables the representation of relationships between objects to build
         up various kinds of structures.
         
         
         The structures are defined for part definitions, for part instances that are particular
         occurrences of part definitions, or between part definitions and part instances.
         
         
         Part instances are used to identify an occurrence of a component in an assembly structure,
         e.g., to identify the elements of an alternative solution.
         
         
         Among these structures there is a hierarchical assembly structure to represent the
         relationships be-tween constituents and the assembly.
         
         
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         
         ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;.
         
         
         This capability enables the representation of parent-child structures, so-called breakdowns.
         A breakdown consists of breakdown elements. Different types of breakdowns and breakdown
         elements are distinguished, such as functional and physical. Breakdowns may be views
         of actual product structures with relations to only some of their constituents.
         
         
         This capability also enables the representation of alternative solutions, such as
         final, supplier or technical solutions. These are implementations of functional and
         physical breakdown elements.
         	
         
         Finally, part instances, that is, occurrences of parts in certain locations, can be
         associated with breakdown elements by means of this capability 
         
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;.
         
         
         This capability enables the classification of product or activity data. 
         It allows for the identification of classes. Classes can be defined in a class system
         and put into hierarchical relationships. 
         Classification information can be assigned to product or activity data. 
         The association of classes and product data can be characterized by property definitions.
         
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;;;;.
         
         
         This capability provides mechanisms to identify a single manufacturable product out
         of a large num-ber of variants. 
         The main concepts that are used to handle this identification of a single manufacturable
         product are the following:
         
         Product configurations are used to identify a manufacturable product out of a possibly
         large number of variants of a product class by its associated specifications without
         having an explicit representation of the product, e.g., a customer order for a car.Product design association is used to associate an implicit representation of a manufacturable
         product (ProductConfiguration) with its explicit representation (PartVersion).Manufacturing configuration is used to specify the validity of occurrences of parts
         (PartInstance) with regard to manufacturing aspects in the context of an implicit
         as well as an explicit representation of a manufacturable product (ProductConfiguration,
         PartVersion).Configurations are used to configure part instances, alternative solutions, breakdown
         elements, and process plans in the context of the conditions (ClassConditionAssociation,
         ClassSpecificationAssociation) under which they are valid.
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;;;;;.
         
         
         This capability represents information concerning the management of documents and
         their versions.  
         A managed document is under revision control, and may distinguish various representation
         definitions of a document version.  
         The document version represents the minimum identification of a managed document under
         revision control.  
         Base document identification is always associated with at least one document version.
         
         Multiple document versions of a base document identification may be related together
         to represent document version history, 
         or to state that one document version is derived from another document version. 
         Documents may be classified according to specific criteria.
         
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;.
         
         
         This capability represents information concerning the relationships between document
         definitions and files, and the association of properties to documents and files.
         Document structure on representation and file level is supported by defining relationships
         between DocumentDefinitions or Files.
         Document properties can be associated with representations of documents as well as
         with individual files. 
         If document properties are assigned to representations of documents, the characteristics
         apply as well to all the constituent files of the document representation in most
         cases.  
         Some properties with numeric values, such as 'file size' and 'page count', 
         applied to the document representation will not correspond to an individual file in
         a multiple file document representation, 
         but to the sum of all the files that make up the particular document representation
         definition.
         
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;.  
         
         The Effectivity capability represents information concerning the validity of data.
         Implicit propagation of data specifying validity is not available. The validity of
         data can be expressed by effectivities that specify, for example, time ranges within
         which data may be used. Explicit dates or dates expressed by events can be used in
         order to represent the relevant points in time. Validity may also be expressed for
         individual parts, which are identified by serial numbers.
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;;;;.
         
         
         This capability represents information concerning the management of externally defined
         models and their relationships. 
         The external can be either an not further specified model, a 3D geometric model, or
         a two dimensional image. 
         This capability further provides reference mechanisms to classes or properties defined
         in external libraries.
         
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;;;;.
         
         This capability specifies the application of Information rights.
         The following is in scope of this capability:
         approval of a specific grant of a right against particular items of information;approval of the general grant of the right;association of the right to particular information items;definition of an information right;historical record of granting and revoking a right to a person or organization;identification of the contract under which the right is granted;relationship of information usage rights to each other.
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;.
         
         This capability enables the representation of motion of kinematic frames along paths.
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;;;;;;;.
         
         
         This capability enables the representation of material by means of its properties
         and the association of material with products. 
         The representation of the chemical structure of material is out of scope of this capability.
         
         The following fundamental concepts and assumptions apply:
         material properties are defined by the environment that they are measured in;such environments are described in terms of other types of properties;material properties characterize some aspects of the behaviour of a product;material properties are assigned to one or several materials, which may 
         be associated with one or several products.
         The following engineering considerations should be taken into account when using this
         capability:
         Material properties may be determined from measurements on the product as a whole,
         on a sample taken from 
         the product in some way such as cutting, or an entirely separate test piece prepared
         by processing in the same 
         way as the product. The application of the results derived from a test piece to the
         whole product is dependent on 
         the relationship to the sample to the product because, as a result of the manufacturing
         process, the product 
         may neither be homogeneous nor isotropic.The values of most properties of a product are influenced by the effect that the manufacturing
         process has had on 
         the product. The manufacturing process may affect the type and amounts of the units
         that make up the product and their 
         form and arrangement. These units may be atoms, molecules or other aggregates of these
         in discrete forms such as crystals, 
         fibres or volumes of semi-crystalline or glassy solids. The arrangement of the units
         is the material structure of the 
         product.The material structure of a solid product may be either homogeneous or heterogeneous,
         or a mixture of solids, 
         such as in composite structures. A complete specification of the structure includes
         the relationship of any preferentially 
         aligned elements of the structure to each other and to the product.
         The following examples show how this capability may be used:
         A manufacturer may make a product to a specification and, instead of reporting actual
         measurements from a specific batch of the product, he may report the nominal value
         indicated in the specification.
         A chemist may perform calculations using assumed values of bond strengths to predict
         the strength of a polymer that has never been synthesised.
         An engineer performing a finite element analysis on a part might assign property values
         to predict potential product performance as a function of the property.
         A designer may specify material characteristics to achieve the required functionality
         of a part or to satisfy aesthetic or similar requirements.
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;;.
         
         This capability enables the representation of machining specific relationships among
         product and activity data.
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;;;.
         
         
         This capability enables the representation of the language used in text attributes
         and the association of translations to these texts. 
         Languages can be specified by a country and language code according to ISO 3166-1
         resp. ISO 639-2. 
         This information may be used to identify the language in which a text attribute is
         expressed. 
         Translations in particular languages may be associated with a text attribute.
         The following business objects are used by this capability:

         This capability provides the ability to represent basic product management information.
         
         It includes information about parts that are either piece parts, raw materials, products,
         software, or tools, and about versions of them.

         This capability represents information concerning organizations and people in organizations
         as they perform functions related to other product data and data relationships. 
         A person shall exist in the context of some organization.  
         An organization or a person in an organization is then associated with the data or
         data relationship in some role indicating the function being performed. 
         Both people and organizations may have addresses associated with them. 
         Date and time can be used in combination with persons and organizations or directly
         associated with product data. 
         Date and time information consists of simple calendar dates or time stamps more complex
         definitions like spans of time or events.

         This capability provides the ability to represent information about physically realized
         parts, 
         assembly structures of physically realized parts and results gained by testing physically
         realized parts of assemblies.

         This capability represents information concerning the implementation of requirements.
         
         Design intent can be described by a set of properties with relation to a requirement
         (planned characteristic). 
         The result of an evaluation of the design can be logged (evaluated characteristic).
         
         The following is in scope of this capability:
         classification of the evaluation result;classification of the evaluation type;details of the test or evaluation procedure;identification of the requirement for the evaluation;product properties based on a specific product definition that are planned for a specific
         end use or manufacturing environment;results of the evaluation of a specific product definition in a specific end use or
         manufacturing environment.
         The following business objects are used by this capability:
         ;.
         
         
         This capability enables the representation of process related data. 
         This includes process plans, versions of process plans with version tracking, process
         operations and properties of processes.
         A process plan is decomposed into one or more occurrences of process operations. 
         Process plans and process operations establish relationships among raw materials,
         in-process items, and final items, 
         as well as the relationship between the items and the tools used to manufacture them.
         Additionally, the representation of the connection of parts in various kinds of mating
         is part of this capability.

         This capability enables the specification of properties and their association with
         other product data like parts or documents. 
         A property is the definition of a special quality and may reflect physics or arbitrary,
         user defined measurements. 
         A general pattern for instantiating property information is defined by this capability.
         
         A number of pre-defined property type names are also specified for use when appropriate.
         Properties can exist independently from their association with product or activity
         data. 
         Properties are defined globally and have a value associated. 
         Independent properties may be assigned to product data.
         For simple use cases, which do not require the full property concept, a simple property
         mechanism is provided. 
         This allows for the association of a name value pair with product data.

         This capability is for the representation of the data that identify a requirement
         and versions of requirements. 
         The concept of a "requirement", in this context, relates chiefly to the exchange and
         sharing of data between requirements engineering applications such as those used in
         the systems engineering 
         and related industrial domains.

         This capability represents information to associate parts with shape and with the
         role of this shape. 
         A shape description may consist of several portions that may be related and their
         roles.

         This capability provides the capability to describe products with a large number of
         variants.
          Examples for automotive products are passenger cars, trucks, busses, or engines or
         components of these products. 
         Because of the large number of variants there is no unique identification for each
         of the variants that could be produced. The main concepts that are used to handle
         this large number of variants are the following:
         product classes are used to identify sets of similar products to be offered to the
         market;specifications are used to describe characteristics of the products;specification categories are used to group similar characteristics of the products;specification expressions are used to control the usage of a part within a product
         and to represent conditions for product classes;

         This part of ISO 10303 is supplemented with module ISO 10303-3001. This module contains
         a
         Business Object model that is specific to this part of ISO 10303. The BO model includes
         an
         information model that is on a higher level of granularity than the ARM of this part
         of
         ISO 10303 to be better suited for the communication with and understandability by
         experts
         of the domains aerospace, defense and automotive. It consists of Business Objects
         that
         represent major concepts and information requirements of a subset of this part of
         ISO
         10303. It uses the vocabulary of the STEP modules where this vocabulary reflects the
         terminology of the domain experts; otherwise, new vocabulary is introduced. The
         relationship between the Business Object model and the ARM of this part of ISO 10303
         is
         explained in the Business Object model module ISO 10303-3001. A technical discussion
         of
         the business object model is contained in Annex H of this part of ISO 10303. 
         The business object model may be incorporated using a different mechanism in a later
         draft. Currently, it is included as the business object model module  ISO/TS
         10303-3001. The product structure related conformance options are:

          ISO/TS
         10303-442 defines the full information model for this part of ISO 10303 by
         providing a single root for all of the modules normatively referenced. 
         ActivityARMActivity.chosenMethod
          For various reasons, some entities may not be completely exported into an exchange
         structure. There may be mandatory information in the MIM that has no correspondence
         in the
         ARM. Sometimes an application may not maintain all the information that is anticipated
         for
         the data exchange. Other times, the information may be maintained by a sending system
         but
         not included in the data exchange. Nevertheless, the preprocessor must provide values
         for
         all mandatory attributes in an exchange file. 
          When no data is provided by a sending system for a string value, the preprocessor
         shall
         use '/NULL' or the empty string ''.  To further indicate the reason why no data is
         provided, the following convention shall be used: empty string '' indicates user data managed by the sending system but not provided
         for
         data exchange;string '/NULL' indicates user data in a mandatory attribute that is not managed by
         the
         sending system or currently not known or a mandatory MIM information that has no
         correspondence in the ARM;$ is used in the physical file, if an optional attribute is not instantiated.
         In general, the empty null string '' or the default string '/NULL' shall not be used
         as
         valid user data. 
         In case a mandatory MIM instance has no ARM correspondence through the mapping and
         no
         useful values can be provided the MIM instance shall be created with minimal 'dummy'
         information: 
         Empty string '' or string '/NULL' for all mandatory string type attributes with the
         same distinction as defined above; Omission of all optional attributes ($ in the physical file). This rule applies
         recursively to further mandatory referenced instances in the AIM. 
         
         The following cases give examples for such required '' 'dummy' MIM instances: 
         ARM object: Project maps to MIM element: organizational_project, mandatory MIM
         reference is organizational_project.responsible_organizations S[1:?] to organization,
         'dummy' MIM instance is organization with organization.name = '/NULL'. ARM object Product_class maps to MIM element product_concept, mandatory MIM
         reference is product_concept.market_context to product_concept_context, 'dummy' MIM
         instances are: product_concept_context with
         product_concept_context.market_segment_type = '/NULL' and
         application_context_element.name = '/NULL' (inherited mandatory attribute),
         application_context with application_context.application = '/NULL' 
         
         
          If the implementation method is ISO 10303-21, the file format shall be encoded according
         to the syntax and EXPRESS language mapping defined in ISO 10303-21 and to the MIM
         schema
         referenced in  of this part of ISO 10303. 
          The FILE_SCHEMA element of the header shall specify the name of the EXPRESS schema
         used
         and include its object information identifier (see ). 
          The instance below identifies the Ap242_managed_model_based_3d_engineering_mim_lf
         extended schema: 
         
         FILE_SCHEMA (('AP242_MANAGED_MODEL_BASED_3D_ENGINEERING_MIM_LF { 1 0 10303 242 3 1
         4} '))
         
         
          If the implementation method is ISO 10303-28, the file format shall be encoded according
         to the syntax and an XML schema referenced in Annex G of this part of ISO 10303. 
         
         
         
         Due to the current practice of direct use of the generic modules from the STEP modules
         repository within APs (AP) instead of tailoring and adapting them to the concrete
         use cases
         that shall be supported by an AP, the APs based on modules are much more generic than
         traditional monolithic APs. Since the STEP modules are modelled to be useable by
         theoretically any AP which all have different requirements a lot of compromises were
         done
         inside the modules which often results in complex modelling constructs. In addition,
         the
         lack of real integration work for the STEP modules has lead to an inconsistent set
         of
         modules. In order to overcome these drawbacks the concept of a Business Object Model
         to the
         STEP architecture was introduced. 
         
         
         
         The AP 242 Business Object Model (in the following just Business Object Model or BO
         Model)
         is an information model which is on a high level of granularity and thus is suited
         for the
         communication with and understandability by domains experts of Aerospace and Defence
         and
         Automotive. It consists of Business Objects (BO) representing major concepts and information
         requirements of Model Based 3D Engineering in these domains and uses the vocabulary
         of the
         STEP modules where this vocabulary reflects the terminology of the domain experts.
         For
         example, in the Business Object Model you find the BO Part with explicit attributes
         id, name
         and description. However, the generic template object Product of the modules is not
         part of
         the Business Object Model. 
         The Business Object Model is complemented by a Business Object XML Schema for SOA
         applications. This XML schema is derived from the Business Object Model EXPRESS by
         an XML
         configuration specification according to ISO 10303‐28 that dives the generation of
         the AP
         242 Business Object XML Schema. There is exactly one configuration specification defined
         in
         AP 242 to avoid different variations of the AP 242 Business Object XML Schema. 
         Figure 1 gives the details of the Business Object Model approach and its position
         within AP
         242. 
         
         
         The introduction of the Business Object Model is a new capability in the documentation
         of
         an AP. The starting point for the development of the Business Object Model was the
         current
         AP 214 Edition 3 ARM, which provides the almost right granularity of BO. The functionalities
         of AP203 2nd Edition and the new functionalities were the added stepwise. The ARM
         of AP242
         looks more like the current AP 203 edition 2 ARM to preserve the consistency with
         other
         modular APs. The Business Object Model provides a view on the AP 242 ARM Longform.
         Consequently the Business Object Model is defined as an EXPRESS model with a mapping
         to the
         ARM of AP 242. The Business Object Model and the mapping to the AP 242 ARM is part
         of AP
         242. The documentation form of the Business Object Model includes EXPRESS, EXPRESS‐G
         textual
         definitions and examples for the BO. 
         
         
         AP 242 has the following two implementation forms:
         Part 21 files conform to the AP 242 MIM Longform schemaXML files conform to the AP 242 Business Object XML Schema
         The relationship between the two implementation forms is explicitly provided in AP
         242 by
         the mapping specification (ARM to MIM, clause 5.1), the mapping from the Business
         Object
         Model to the AP 242 ARM, and the XML configuration specification (EXPRESS of AP 242
         Business
         Object Model to XML schema, new annex in AP 242). On this basis implementations can
         be
         real-ized to convert AP 242 Part 21 files into XML files and vice versa. 
         
         As AP 242 allows for both MIM Longform and XML implementations on the Business Object
         Model
         level, recommendations and rules are required, when which implementation form should
         be
         used, such as the ARM for composite materials. Such recommendations are defined outside
         of
         this standard in dedicated AP 242 Recommended Practices.
         
         AP 242 describes the implementation technology without ambiguity. Example: the standard
         contains both the Business Object XML schema and the XML configuration specification.
         There
         is only a single one Part 28 configuration specification within AP 242. Currently
         for STEP
         modular APs, multiple different XML schemas are allowed and might be implemented.
         Figure 2 shows on the one hand side the relationship between the different data models
         of
         AP 242 (i.e., Business Object Model, Business Object Model XML Schema, ARM Long-form,
         and
         MIM Longform) and on the other hand their relationships to implementations forms of
         AP 242
         as well as the use case for having a data repository capable of storing and retrieving
         data
         to/form this repository in both ways, i.e., as a p21 file governed by the MIM Longform
         and
         an XML/stream file governed by the Business Object XML Schema.
         
         Figure 3 depicts some of the foreseen combinations for AP 242 based implementations.
         
         
         
         
         
         AP 242 BOM uses the principle of explicit modelling and uses the concept of strong
         classification (as currently defined in AP 203 ed2 and AP 214 ed3, e.g., permissive
         list
         values for relation types) for clearly defined domains like geometry, or analysis.
         These
         kinds of classifications shall be explicitly defined in the standard. For product

         and other PLM/PDM type information AP 242 shall enable the use of an externally augmented
         classification built upon a frame-work template like ISO 22745, ISO 13584, or other
         RDLs.
         
         
         
         An AP242 Business Object consists of attributes and relationships and represents one
         or
         more application concepts of the underlying (aerospace and automotive) domain of AP242.
         The
         Business Object Model of AP242 is the union of all BO. It represents the scope of
         AP 242 –
         “Managed Model Based 3D Engineering” by representing all relevant application concepts.
         The Business Object Model is divided into a number of subject areas or so called
         Capabilities. Each Capability in AP 242 contains a number of Business Objects that
         belongs
         together from a logical point of view, i.e., it serves the organization and summarization
         the underlying functionality of the Business Object Model and is therefore a mechanism
         for
         modularizing the scope of the BO Model. Any two Capabilities are mutual exclusive,
         i.e., the
         intersection of two Capabilities is empty, and i.e., each BO is exclusively assigned
         top one
         Capability. Figure 4 summarizes the Capabilities defined within AP 242.
