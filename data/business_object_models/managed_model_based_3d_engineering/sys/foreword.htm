      <p>
         ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
         federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of
         preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
         technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for
         which a technical committee has been established has the right to be
         represented on that committee. International organizations,
         governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take
         part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International
         Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical
         standardization.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC
         Directives, Part 2.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The main task of technical committees is to prepare International
         Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical
         committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as
         an International Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the member
         bodies casting a vote.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         	In other circumstances, particularly when there is an urgent market 
         	requirement for such documents, a technical committee may decide to publish 
         	other types of normative document: 
         
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            	  an ISO Publicly Available Specification (ISO/PAS) represents an
            	  agreement between technical experts in an ISO working group and  is
            	  accepted for publication if it is approved by more than 50% 
            	  of the members of the parent committee casting a vote;
            	
         </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            	  an ISO Technical Specification (ISO/TS) represents an agreement between 
            	  the members of a technical committee and is accepted for
            	  publication if it is approved by 2/3 of the members of the committee
            	  casting a vote. 
            	
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         	An ISO/PAS or ISO/TS is reviewed after three years in order to decide
         	whether it will be confirmed for a further three years, revised to become
         	an International Standard, or withdrawn.  If the ISO/PAS or ISO/TS is
         	confirmed, it is reviewed again after a further three years, at which time
         	it must either be transformed into an International Standard or be
         	withdrawn.

      <p>ISO/TS 10303-3001
         was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 184, 
         <i>Automation systems and integration</i>,
         Subcommittee SC4, <i>Industrial data</i>.
         
      </p> This is that first edition of ISO 10303-3001. 
      <p>
         ISO 10303 is organized as a series of parts, each published
         separately. The structure of ISO 10303 is described in ISO 10303-1.
         <sup><a href="#10303-1">1</a>)
            </sup></p>
      <p>
         Each part of ISO 10303 is a member of one of the following series:
         description methods, implementation methods, conformance testing
         methodology and framework, integrated generic resources, integrated
         application resources, application protocols, abstract test suites,
         application interpreted constructs and application modules. 
         This part is a member of the application protocols series.
