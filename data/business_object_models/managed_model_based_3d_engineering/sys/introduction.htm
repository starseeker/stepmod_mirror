      <p>
         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable representation
         of
         product information and for the exchange of product data. The objective is to provide
         a
         neutral mechanism capable of describing products throughout their life cycle. This
         mechanism
         is suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing
         and
         sharing product databases, and as a basis for retention and archiving.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         This part of ISO 10303 specifies the business object model for ISO 10303-
         3001, Managed model based 3D engineering. 
         The information model of this
         part of ISO 10303 is on a higher level of granularity than the ARM of ISO 10303-INSERT
         AP # to
         be better suited for the communication with and understandability by experts of the
         domains
         aerospace, defence and automotive. It consists of Business Objects that represent
         major
         concepts and information requirements of a subset of ISO 10303-INSERT AP #, INSERT
         AP TITLE.
         It uses the vocabulary of the STEP modules where this vocabulary reflects the terminology
         of
         the domain experts; otherwise, new vocabulary is introduced. The relationship between
         the
         business object model and the ARM of ISO 10303-INSERT AP # is explained in this part
         of ISO
         10303. A technical discussion of the business object model is contained in Annex H
         of ISO
         10303-INSERT AP #.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Clause <a href="1_scope.htm">1</a> defines the scope of the business object model and
         summarizes the functionality and data covered. Clause <a href="3_defs.htm">3</a> lists
         the terms defined in this part of ISO 10303 and provides pointers to words to terms
         defined
         elsewhere. The BO Model of the application are specified in Clause 
         <a href="4_info_reqs.htm">4</a> using terminology appropriate to the application. A
         graphical representation of the information requirements, referred to as the BO model,
         is
         given in Annex <a href="annex_arm_expg.htm">C</a>. A UML representation is given in
         Annex <a href="annex_bom_uml.htm">D</a>. A mapping of the BO model to the to xml schema
         is given in Annex <a href="annex_xsd_der.htm">B</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         In ISO 10303, the same English language words can be used to refer to an object in
         the real
         world or concept, and as the name of an EXPRESS data type that represents this object
         or
         concept.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The following typographical convention is used to distinguish between these. If a
         word or
         phrase occurs in the same typeface as narrative text, the referent is the object or
         concept.
         If the word or phrase occurs in a bold typeface or as a hyperlink, the referent is
         the EXPRESS
         data type.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The name of an EXPRESS data type can be used to refer to the data type itself, or
         to an
         instance of the data type. The distinction between these uses is normally clear from
         the
         context. If there is a likelihood of ambiguity, either the phrase "entity data type"
         or
         "instance(s) of" is included in the text.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Double quotation marks " " denote quoted text. Single quotation marks ' ' denote particular
         text string values.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         
         This part of ISO 10303 specifies a business object model document for ISO 10303-242,
         
         managed model-based 3d engineering.
         The information model of this part of ISO 10303 is less granular than the ARM of ISO
         10303-242 and is, 
         therefore, better suited for communication with and understandability by experts of
         the aerospace, defense and automotive domains. 
         It comprises Business Objects that represent major concepts and information requirements
         of a subset of ISO 10303-242, 
         model-based 3d engineering. 
         It uses the vocabulary of the STEP modules where this vocabulary reflects the terminology
         of the domain experts;
         otherwise, new vocabulary is introduced. 
         The relationship between the business object model and the ARM of ISO 10303-242 is
         explained in this part of ISO 10303. 
         A technical discussion of the business object model is contained in Annex H of ISO
         10303-242.
