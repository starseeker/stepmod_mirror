   change Log:
   Issues addressed for TC1:
   #5447: ConfiguredItemSelect and ConfiguredSpecificationSelect removed
   #5067: cardinality changed from [1:?] 1 for assignedTo attrbutes
   #5710: In CartesianTransformation, for attributes rotationMatrix and translationVector: Lenghtmeasure changed to REAL.
          WR added to constrain the values for rotationMatrix to -1..1 inclusive
   #5709: Add INV attribute for ComposedGeomtericModel.composedModels to constrain the GeometricRepresentationRelationship.relating to [1:?]
   #5619: New entity GeneralGeometricRepresentationRelationship added as subtype of GeometricRepresentationRelationship with attribute RelationType
   #5616: In GeometricRepresentationRelationshipWithSameCoordinateSpace. New derived attribute SELF\GeometricRepresentationRelationship.definitional : BOOLEAN := .TRUE. added
   #4984: ProductPlannedToRealized added in SUPERTYPE clause of IndividualPartVersionRelationship
   #5620: In PartView new attribute auxiliaryGeometry with type GeometricModel and cardinality OPTONAL SET[1:?] added. Where rule added.
   #4985: MaterialPropertyDefinition added in SUPERTYPE clause of PropertyDefinition
   #4951: In InformationUsageRightAssignment renamed attribute "isAssignedTo" to "assignedTo"
   #5682: Entity SelectedOccurrence merged into QuantifiedOccurrence
   #5688: New entities PartShapeElement and OccurrenceShapeELement added. Entity AssemblyJoint modified
   #5078: New type OccurrenceOrOccurrenceDefinitionSelect, new entity DefinitionBasedOccurrence added. Entities Occurrence, SingleOccurrence, QuantifiedOccurrence, SpecifiedOccurrence, ViewOccurrenceRelationship modified.
   #5693,#5698: New entities Representation, RepresentationContext added. GeometricRepresentation, GeometricCoordinateSpace modified.
   #5864: Entity RepresentationRelationship added
