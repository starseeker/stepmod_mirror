	<p>This document specifies the use of ISO 10303 integrated resources that satisfy the information sharing requirements
         for design engineers, device design engineers, value added engineering data suppliers, design analysts, system engineers,
         and manufacturing process planning engineers. The information is shared to transform the detailed design
         of and requirements for either an electronic assembly or an interconnect substrate into either a manufacturable
         description or an analysable description. Device data is shared to assure adequate product design and for source
         control purposes.
