  <h3 id="smrl_1">6.1 Series of parts</h3>
  <p>The STEP Module and Resource Library (SMRL) includes the following documents:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>modular &tr-application-protocols;: members of the &tr-application-protocol; series of parts (ISO 10303 parts 201 to 299) that conform to the modular architecture;</li>
    <li>&tr-application-module; series of parts: ISO 10303 parts 401 to 499 and 1001 to 1999;</li>
    <li>&tr-application-interpreted-construct; series of parts: ISO 10303 parts 501 to 599;</li>
    <li>&tr-integrated-resource; series of parts: ISO 10303 parts 41 to 199;</li>
    <li>logical model of expressions: ISO 13584-20.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="smrl_2">6.2 Navigation</h3>
  <p>Each part belonging to the SMRL is maintained as a separate ISO document. 
    However, the individual parts belonging to the SMRL will not be sold or distributed separately; 
    they will only be sold and distributed as part of a package consisting of the entire SMRL. 
    The SMRL product contains a top-level structure that provides
    navigation indices
    for the parts that are included in the SMRL.</p>
  <p>The modular APs make use of the &tr-application-modules; and &tr-AICs; and &tr-IRs; in the SMRL.</p>
  <p>Other &tr-APs; make use of the &tr-AICs; and &tr-IRs;.</p>
