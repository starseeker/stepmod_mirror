  <h3 id="smrl_1">6.1 Series of parts</h3>
  <p>The STEP Module and Resource Library (SMRL) includes the following documents:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="2_defs.htm#term_application_module">application modules</a> series of parts: ISO 10303 parts 401 to 499 and 1001 to 1999;</li>
    <li><a href="2_defs.htm#term_application_interpreted_construct">application interpreted constructs</a> series of parts: ISO 10303 parts 501 to 599;</li>
    <li><a href="2_defs.htm#term_integrated_resource">integrated resources</a> series of parts: ISO 10303 parts 41 to 59;</li>
    <li>logical model of expressions: ISO 13584-20.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="smrl_2">6.2 Navigation</h3>
  <p>Each part belonging to the SMRL is maintained as a separate ISO document. 
    However, the individual parts belonging to the SMRL will not be sold or distributed separately; 
    they will only be sold and distributed as part of a package consisting of the entire SMRL. 
    The SMRL product contains a top-level structure that provides
    navigation indices
    for the parts that are included in the SMRL.</p>
  <p>The modular APs make use of the <a href="2_defs.htm#term_application_module">application modules</a> in the SMRL.</p>
  <p>Other <a href="2_defs.htm#term_application_protocol">APs</a> make use of the <a href="2_defs.htm#term_application_interpreted_construct">AICs</a> and <a href="2_defs.htm#term_integrated_resource">IRs</a>.</p>
