  <h3 id="smrl_2">6.2 Navigation in the library</h3>
  <p>Each part belonging to the SMRL is maintained as a separate ISO document. 
    However, the individual parts belonging to the SMRL will not be sold or distributed separately; 
    they will only be sold and distributed as part of a package consisting of the entire SMRL. 
    The SMRL product contains a top-level structure that provides
    <a href="frame_index.htm" target="index">navigation indices</a>
    for the parts that are included in the SMRL.</p>
  <p>The modular APs make use of the application modules in the SMRL.</p>
  <p>Other ISO 10303 application protocols make use of the AICs and IRs.</p>
