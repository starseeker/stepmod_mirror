    <a name="info_obj">7 Information object registration</a>
  </h2>

  <p>
In order to provide unambiguous identification of schemas and other information objects in an
open information system, this International Standard employs the registration technique defined
in ISO/IEC 8824-l. This technique identifies objects by their assignment to a’ tree structure
whose root is IS0 itself. Each node in the tree is identified by a sequence of integers corresponding
to the index of the leaf under each node. Nodes that identify agencies that can further specify
inferior nodes are called registration authorities. There is provision in this technqiue for having
registration provided by national bodies and other identified organizations (including private
corporations). A registration authority is automatically granted to the technical committee or
subcommittee that prepares a standard in order to identify objects within the standard. Thus,
IS0 10303 is identified by the object identifier:
  </p> 
  <p align="center">
    { 1 0 10303 }
  </p> 
  <p>
    Here the initial 1 indicates ISO; the 0 following it identifies the object as a standard, and the
    number following that is the number of the standard. ISO/IEC 8824-l also defines identifiers to
    stand in the place of these numbers; thus ‘iso’ has the value 1 and ‘standard’ has the value 0.
    For multi-part standards, the next number is required to be the part number. Thus, this part
    of IS0 10303 is identified by the object identifier:
  </p> 
  <p align="center">
    { iso standard 10303 part(l) }
  </p> 
  <p>
    Here, the value of the part number is given explicitly, but the notation allows us to associate a
    term with this value, thereby providing some semantics. The notation for values of this type is
    defined in clause 28 of ISO/IEC 8824-1, and the predefined assignments are specified in ISO/IEC 8824-l.
  </p> 
  <p>
    For the purposes of identifying information objects unambiguously within an open information
    system, IS0 10303 adopts the following conventions:
  </p> 
  <ul>
    <li>
      The value following the part number shall be version number. By convention, the value
      of the version number of the first edition shall be 1. The value 0, if used at all, is reserved
      to refer to DIS documents.
    </li>
    <li>
      The value following the version number is used to identify the type of information object
      defined within the part. The value 1 shall indicate that the object so identified is a schema.
    </li>
    <li>
      The value following the object type is an integer that identifies the instance of the object
      type so identified.
    </li>
    <li>
      To meet the syntactic requirements of ISO/IEC 8824-1, replace each occurrence of a
      low line in a schema name with a hyphen when defining this value.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="example">
    EXAMPLE In IS0 10303-41, several schemas are defined. The application-context-schema can be identified by the value:
  <p align="center">
    { iso standard 10303 part(41) version(l) object(l) application-context-schema(l) }
  </p> 
    and the product-definition schema can be identified by the value:
  <p align="center">
    { iso standard 10303 part(41) version(l) object(l) product-definition-schema(2) }
  </p>
  </p>
