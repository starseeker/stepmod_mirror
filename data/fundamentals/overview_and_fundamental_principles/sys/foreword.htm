      <p>
         ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
         federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of
         preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
         technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for
         which a technical committee has been established has the right to be
         represented on that committee. International organizations,
         governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take
         part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International
         Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical
         standardization.
         
         
      </p>
      	
      <p>
         International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
         
         
      </p>
      	
      <p>
         The main task of technical committees is to prepare International
         Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical
         committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as
         an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member
         bodies casting a vote. 
         
         
      </p>
      	
      <p>
         In other circumstances, particularly when there is an urgent market
         requirement for such documents, a technical committee may decide to publish
         other types of normative document: 
         
         
      </p>
      	
      <ul>
         		
         <li>
            an ISO Publicly Available Specification (ISO/PAS) represents an
            agreement between technical experts in an ISO working group and is accepted
            for publication if it is approved by more than 50 % of the members of the
            parent committee casting a vote;
            
            
         </li>
         		
         <li>
            an ISO Technical Specification (ISO/TS) represents an agreement
            between the members of a technical committee and is accepted for
            publication if it is approved by 2/3 of the members of the committee
            casting a vote.
            
            
         </li>
         	
      </ul>
      	
      <p>
         An ISO/PAS or ISO/TS is reviewed after three years in order to decide 
         whether it will be confirmed for a further three years, revised to become
         an International Standard, or withdrawn. If the ISO/PAS or ISO/TS is
         confirmed, it is reviewed again after a further three years, at which time
         it must either be transformed into an International Standard or be
         withdrawn.
         
         
      </p>

         this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held

      <p>ISO 10303-1
         was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 184, 
         <i>Automation systems and integration</i>,
         Subcommittee SC4, <i>Industrial data</i>.

      <p>
         This second edition of ISO 10303-1 cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 10303-1:1994), of which it constitutes a technical
         revision. 
         	
      </p>
      	
      <p>
         ISO 10303 is organized as a series of parts, each published
         separately. The structure of ISO 10303 is described in this part of ISO 10303.
         	
      </p>
      	
      <p>
         Each part of ISO 10303 is a member of one of the following series:
         description methods, implementation methods, conformance testing
         methodology and framework, integrated generic resources, integrated
         application resources, application protocols, abstract test suites,
         application interpreted constructs and application modules. 
         This part is the only part in the application modules series, and
         	 contains all ISO 10303 application modules.
         
      </p>

         A complete list of parts of ISO 10303 is available from the following URL:
