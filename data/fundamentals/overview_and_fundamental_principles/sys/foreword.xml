         ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
         federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of
         preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
         technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for
         which a technical committee has been established has the right to be
         represented on that committee. International organizations,
         governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take
         part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International
         Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical
         standardization.

         International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
         
      </p>
	<p>
         The main task of technical committees is to prepare International
         Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical
         committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as
         an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member
         bodies casting a vote.

      This second edition of ISO 10303-1 cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 10303-1:1994), of which it constitutes a technical revision. 
	</p>
	<p>
         ISO 10303 is organized as a series of parts, each published
         separately. The structure of ISO 10303 is described in this part of ISO 10303.
	</p>
	<p>
         Each part of ISO 10303 is a member of one of the following series:
         description methods, implementation methods, conformance testing
         methodology and framework, integrated generic resources, integrated
         application resources, application protocols, abstract test suites,
         application interpreted constructs and application modules.
