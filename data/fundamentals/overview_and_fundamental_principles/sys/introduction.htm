         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
         representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
         The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
         products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only
         for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and
         sharing product databases, and as a basis for archiving.
