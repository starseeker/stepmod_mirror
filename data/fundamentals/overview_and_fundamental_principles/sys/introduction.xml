         ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable 
         representation of &tr-product-information; and for the exchange of &tr-product-data;.
         The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing
         &tr-products; throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only
         for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and
         sharing &tr-product; databases, and as a basis for archiving.
