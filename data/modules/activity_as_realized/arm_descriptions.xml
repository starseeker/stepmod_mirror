An <b>Activity_actual</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="activity:arm:Activity_arm.Activity"/>.

It  is a record of the occurrence of an <express_ref linkend="activity:arm:Activity_arm.Activity"/>. The <b>Activity_actual</b>

 is related through an <express_ref linkend="activity_as_realized:arm:Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_happening"/>

 to the <express_ref linkend="activity:arm:Activity_arm.Activity"/> for which it is an occurrence. The existence of an <b>Activity_actual</b>

 instance means that the <express_ref linkend="activity_as_realized:arm:Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_actual"/>

 has started.
<note number="1"> A <express_ref linkend="date_time:arm:Date_time_arm.Calendar_date"/>
or
<express_ref linkend="date_time:arm:Date_time_arm.Date_time"/>

 should be assigned to the <express_ref linkend="activity_as_realized:arm:Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_actual"/>
 with the role "start date" to record when the activity started.</note>

<note number="2"> A <express_ref linkend="date_time:arm:Date_time_arm.Calendar_date"/>
or
<express_ref linkend="date_time:arm:Date_time_arm.Date_time"/>
  may be assigned to the activity with role "end date" to record when the activity finished. In general, the absence of this assignment cannot be used to infer that the activity is continuing, only that the end of the activity has not yet been recorded.</note>
<note number="3"> A more detailed history of the progress of an activity may be recorded by applying states to the activity, but the meaning of these states must be defined through local business rules.</note>

An <b>Activity_happening</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="activity:arm:Activity_arm.Activity_relationship"/>. It is a relationship between the definition of an activity (<express_ref linkend="activity_as_realized:arm:Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_happening.predicted"/>) and its actual occurrence (<express_ref linkend="activity_as_realized:arm:Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_happening.actual"/>).
<note number="1"> The ordinary value for <express_ref linkend="activity:arm:Activity_arm.Activity.name"/> may be "actual", though this is redundant.</note>

<note number="2">  Many <express_ref linkend="activity_as_realized:arm:Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_actual"/>s may be the actual for a single <express_ref linkend="activity:arm:Activity_arm.Activity"/>.

<example number="1">a single defined activity is recorded historically by several sub-activities.</example>

<note number="3"> A single <express_ref linkend="activity_as_realized:arm:Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_actual"/>

<example number="2"> a single servicing activity takes the opportunity to make additional checks and repairs.</example>
