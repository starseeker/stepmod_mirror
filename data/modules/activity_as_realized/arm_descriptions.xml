<ext_description linkend="Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_actual">
<p>
An activity_actual records the occurrence of an activity. The activity_actual is related through an activity_happening to the activity for which it is an occurance. 
</p>
<p>
The existence of an activity_actual instance means that the activity_actual has started.
</p>
<note number="1"> A date or date_and_time should be assigned to the activity_actual with the role "start_date" to record when the activity started.</note>
<note number="2"> A date or date_and_time may be assigned to the activity with role "end_date" to record when the activity finished. In general, the absence of this assignment cannot be used to infer that the activity is continuing, only that the end of the activity has not yet been recorded.</note>
<note number="3"> A more fine grained history of the progress of an activity may be recorded by applying states to the activity, but the meaning of these states must be defined through local business rules.</note>

<ext_description linkend="Activity_as_realized_arm.Activity_happening">
An activity_happening is a relationship between the definition of an activity (activity_happening.predicted) and its actual occurrence (activity_happening.actual).
<note number="1"> The ordinary value for activity.name may be "actual", though this is redundant.</note>
<note number="2">  Many activity_actuals may be the actual for a single activity, for example, where a single defined activity is recorded historically by several sub-activities.</note>
<note number="3"> A single activity_actual may fulfil several activities, for example, where a single servicing activity takes the opportunity to make additional checks and repairs.</note>
