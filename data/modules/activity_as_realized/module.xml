 <purpose>
<p>
An activity is recorded when someone does something to the design of a product, or to an actual product. In PLCS, activities done to an actual product include repair, preventive maintenance, replenishment (e.g. refuelling) amd simple observations about the condition of the product. The function of activity_as_realized is to record who did what to which product, together with when and why.
</p>
<p>
The information model for an activity is the same whether or not the activity has occurred. The concept activity_as_realized is introduced to distinguish between the activity (the data that is created in order to describe the activity) and activity_as_realized (the data that records what was actually occurred). In general, the data recorded against the two will be different. However, even if the intention is carried out exactly, activity_as_realized records that the activity occurred at a particular date, while activity records what ought to have happened, whether or not it did.
