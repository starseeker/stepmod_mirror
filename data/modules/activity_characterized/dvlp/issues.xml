	  The characterization needs to be extended to apply to
Applied_activity_assignment. Currently the ARM does not allow approval of the assignment of an activity (such as planned maintenance) to the item being maintained.
	  Comment applies to all the select types in the ARM.

The module should USE FROM process_property_assignment so that the activity
properties are brought in. The Activity_property should then be
characterized in the same way assigned_property is in ap239_properties. I.e
allow the approval, classification, assignment of date time etc to
Activity_property. 
  </p>
  <p>
The characterized_activity_definition select should be
extended with Applied_activity_assignment to allow the assignment of
properties to the use of an activity. I.e. to allow the representation of
the cost of this activity when applied to ???

Support for multiple languages is required. So USE FROM Multi_linguism and
extend the string_select select.
The mapping to Language_indication and Attribute_translation_assignment
will have to be extended.
Add Activity to string_select
