 <purpose>
   <P>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module to record:</P>
<UL>
<LI> individual activities with their whole-part, connection and involvement
relationships;</LI>
<LI>a library of classes of activity with their whole-part, connection and
involvement relationships;</LI>
<LI>the classification of an individual activity as a member of a class of
activity, and the classification of a relationship between individual
activities as a member of a class of relationship; and</LI>
<LI>the specification of the complete membership for a class of activity or a
class of relationship between activities.</LI>
</UL>
