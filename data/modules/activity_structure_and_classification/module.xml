 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module to record:</p>
<ul>
<li> individual activities with their whole-part, connection and involvement
relationships;</li>
<li>a library of classes of activity with their whole-part, connection and
involvement relationships;</li>
<li>the classification of an individual activity as a member of a class of
activity, and the classification of a relationship between individual
activities as a member of a class of relationship; and</li>
<li>the specification of the complete membership for a class of activity or a
class of relationship between activities.</li>
</ul>
 </purpose>
