An <b>Advanced_brep_shape_representation</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model"/>

 in which the representation items are specializations of the <express_ref linkend="geometric_model_schema:ir_express:geometric_model_schema.manifold_solid_brep"/>

 entity. 
<p>
These specializations differ from the more general B-rep in that they shall only use explicit geometric forms for their face and edge geometry. 
The face geometry is restricted to elementary surfaces, swept surfaces or B-spline surfaces.
</p>
<note number="1">This entity is incompletely modelled in the ARM. Complete specification 
can be obtained in the definition of the corresponding MIM entity.
</note>
<note number="2">Although this only appears in the MIM schema, the faces included in <express_ref linkend="geometric_model_schema:ir_express:geometric_model_schema.manifold_solid_brep"/>s are <express_ref linkend="aic_topologically_bounded_surface:ir_express:aic_topologically_bounded_surface.advanced_face"/>s, as defined in application module Topologically bounded surface.
