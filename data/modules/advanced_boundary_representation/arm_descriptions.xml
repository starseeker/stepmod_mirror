   <ext_description linkend="Advanced_boundary_representation_arm.Advanced_brep_shape_representation">
An <b>Advanced_brep_shape_representation</b> is a type of <b>Geometric_model</b> in which the representation items are specializations of the <b>manifold_solid_brep</b> entity. 
<p>
These specializations differ from the more general B-rep in that they shall only use explicit geometric forms for their face and edge geometry. 
The face geometry is restricted to elementary surfaces, swept surfaces or B-spline surfaces.
</p>
<note number="1">This entity is incompletely modelled in the ARM. Complete specification 
can be obtained in the definition of the corresponding MIM entity.
</note>
<note number="2">Although this only appears in the MIM schema, the faces included in manifold solid breps are <b>advanced_faces</b>, as defined in module <b>topologically_bounded_surface</b>.
