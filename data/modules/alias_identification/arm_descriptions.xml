The alias_identification_item type is an extensible list of alternate data types. It provides a mechanism to refer to instances of the data types included in the types that extend the alias_identification_item type. 
<note number="1">
This empty extensible select requires extension in a further module to ensure that all entities have at least one valid instantiation. 
</note>

<note number="2">The type alias_identification_item is not an extension of the type identification_item, defined in the module Identification_assignment, because 
the capability to get an alias may not be needed for every entity type to which the capability to get additional identifiers is provided.
By nature, alias_identification_item characterizes a smaller set of entity types than identification_item.
