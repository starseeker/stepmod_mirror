   An <b>alias_identification_item</b> type is an extensible list of alternate data types. It provides a mechanism to refer to instances of the data types included in the types that extend the <b>alias_identification_item</b> type. 
<note number="1">
This empty extensible select requires extension in a further module to ensure that all entities have at least one valid instantiation. 
</note>

<note number="2">The type <b>alias_identification_item</b> is not an extension of the type <b>identification_item</b>, defined in the module Identification assignment, because 
the capability to get an alias may not be needed for every entity type to which the capability to get additional identifiers is provided.
By nature, <b>alias_identification_item</b> characterizes a smaller set of entity types than <b>identification_item</b>.
