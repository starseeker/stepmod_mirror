   <ext_description linkend="Alias_identification_arm.Alias_identification"> An <b>Alias_identification</b> is an additional identifier or name that is used to distinguish the object of interest in some different frame of reference. The scope of the frame of reference is specified as either an Organization, a Person Organization, or by a textual description of the type of alias. An <b>Alias_identification</b> may be applied to a part definition, an organization, a file.  This is not for the alias identification of people, dates, projects, or for version identification of parts and documents. This rule insures that either an owner or a role exists for Alias_identification.</ext_description>
