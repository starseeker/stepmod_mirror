<ext_description linkend="Altered_package_arm.predefined_geometric_status">
A <b>predefined_geometric_status</b> lists the possible values of the geometric status.
	<note number="1">The <b>predefined_geometric_status</b> is not a complete
		specification of the transformation required to convert one geometric
		model to another because some of the constraints on the transformation are specified
		as constraints on the geometric relationship between the package terminals and the seating plane.
	</note>
	<example number="1">
		A two pin package that is defined with both pins intersecting the seating plane in the unaltered package 
		will need to have both pins intersect the seating plane in the altered state of the <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>.  
		The exact length
		and other geometric properties of the pins in the altered state will be different from pins in the unaltered state
		if the orientation is different in the altered state of the <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>
		from the unaltered state of the <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>.
	</example>
	<note number="2">
		The selection of datum axis or datum plane as the condition whose state is conveyed
		depends on the geometric classification of the <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>.
	</note>
	<example number="2">
		A pre-processor considering application for a cylindrical package with the terminals protruding
		from the <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/> on axis would use a 
		datum axis as the <b>predefined_geometric_status</b> if a value other than <b>undefined</b> or
		<b>standard_datum_condition</b> were to be specified because the central axis of symmetry is 
		normally considered a 
		<express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_axis"/>.  
	</example>
	<example number="3">
		A pre-processor considering application for a cuboid <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/> that has terminals protruding
		from only one face would use a datum plane as the <b>predefined_geometric_status</b> if a value other than <b>undefined</b> or
		<b>standard_datum_condition</b> were to be specified because the face that has the terminals
		is typically considered a 
		<express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_plane"/>.

<p>
	An <b>Altered_package</b> is a type of 
	<express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>. 
	An <b>Altered_package</b> describes a  
	<express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/> 
	that has been modified in some manner from a reference  
	<express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>.  
	The material or shape properties of the <b>Altered_package</b> are different from the reference  
	<express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>.
</p>
<note number="1">
The reference information provided by <b>package_to_be_altered</b> is used for traceability information and is
not used for definitional purposes.
</note>
	<example number="1">
		Examples of alteration include trimming of the terminals, prebending of the terminals, tinning of the 
		terminals for solderability, or more than one of these.
	</example>
	<example number="2">
		Figure 1 illustrates some of the different forms a 
		<express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package">Package</express_ref> may take when it is installed into an assembly.  
		For illustration purposes, the original form on the left is in the role of <b>package_to_be_altered</b> for the forms on the right.  
		The altered forms are identified and tracked by an enterprise.

	<note number="3">
		Although Figure 1 illustrates <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/> alteration of axially leaded packages with a 
		starting condition of terminals central axis congruent with the central axis of the body,
		two dimensional CAD interconnect layout systems typically ignore that condition because there are no terminals intersecting with the seating plane in that condition.
		To use this part of ISO 10303 to communicate information about an altered state, at least one of the terminals of a modified <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>
		should intersect a seating plane.
