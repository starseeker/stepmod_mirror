An <b>Altered_package</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>. An <b>Altered_package</b> describes a <b>Package</b> that has been modified in some manner from a reference <b>Package</b>. The material or shape properties of the <b>Altered_package</b> are different from the reference <b>Package</b>. <example number="1">Examples of alteration include trimming of the terminals, prebending of the terminals, tinning of the terminals for solderability, or more than one of these. </example>
        <example number="2">Figure <express_ref linkend="prepac:arm:prepac_arm.prepac"/> illustrates some of the different forms a <b>package</b> may take when it is installed into an assembly. The original form on the left is in the role of <b>to_be_altered</b> for the forms on the right. The altered forms are identified and tracked by an enterprise. </example>
        <note>Most <b>Altered_packages</b> are a result of terminal alteration. </note>
