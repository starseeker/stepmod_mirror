Need to add Digital_port_variable, similar to transform port variable;also probably need to 
modify the model_parameter type assignment for the boolean,logical,string since
these may not be appropriate.
another option: to have a 'digital word' representation of an quantity in addition to
the 'analog' representation.

Decided not to accept this proposed solution, since digital port already has a name.  I do agree to add an external_definition to attribute digital_analytical_model_port.port_type, but not sure how the current syntax for external_definition works.

Compromise is to map analog_port_variable to analog_port_variable instead of port_variable, leaving some room in future for different decision if need be.

Added notes and example explaining use of Signal specification to provide experimental data exchange capability of 'as simulated' digital port 'state' including problematic 'unknown', 'unitialized', 'high-impedance'.  The solution is based on the fact that the issue was experimental data driven and that the Signal_specification explicitly specifies the Functional_unit_terminal to apply the signal to and does not assume the network node is the point of application of the signal.
If it is found during analog simulation experiments that this is problematic, then when Signal_specification is revised, this will need to be revisited, as a mechanism must be provided to apply state information directly to Functional_unit_terminals when they are mapped to application of Digital_analytical_model_ports.

Should not the Analytical_model_application_assignment also reference a set of Analytical_model_port_assignments?  That would allow a collector type mechanism...

Effectively this is already established by the Analytical_model_application being referenced by Analytical_model_port_assignment.  This issue is resolved whenever we figure out how to do that.

This AO is redundant once the proposed change to analytical_model_port_assignment is implemented

  ENTITY Analytical_model_application_assignment; --- was analytical_model_definition_assignment;
	assigned_analytical_model: Analytical_model_application;
	assigned_item: analytical_model_application_assignment_select;
  END_ENTITY; -- Analytical_model_application_assignment

Analytical_model_port_assignment has never been directly related to Analytical_model_application (using current terminology).  The introduction of the Analytical_model_application_assignment made this problem more obvious since there was no connection between amaa and ampa.  There is obviously cause for concern since it is possible for
an amaa to be made and there be no ampa and vice versa.  when a relationship is built between an amaa and a set of ampa, that builds in redundant paths that have to be managed.  In actuality all that is needed is to relate an ampa to an ama.  Then the paths that need to be managed are straightformward:

ampa[#22]->ama[any]->Analytical_model_definition[#1]
ampa[#22]->Analytical_model_port[any]->Analytical_model_definition[#1]

Unique rule on ampa potentially could help alleviate confusion but that is tbd.

ampa modification:::
  ENTITY Analytical_model_port_assignment;
	assigned_analytical_model_port	: analytical_model_port;
	assigned_item					: analytical_model_port_assignment_select;
	associated_analytical_model_application :analytical_model_application;
(* where rule
   we can now write a sensible where rule that states that the
   associated_analytical_model_port.accessed_analytical_model =
   associated_analytical_model_application.model_representation
   *)
   WHERE
    WR1 : associated_analytical_model_port.accessed_analytical_model =
   associated_analytical_model_application.model_representation;
  END_ENTITY; -- analytical_model_port_assignment
(*mapping of analytical_model_port_assignment::
   complex subtype of prop_def_rep,representation_relationship
   prop_def_rep.used_rep->self
   prop_def_rep.definition -> same as now
   representation_relationship.rep_1 ->associated_ama
   representation_relationship.rep_2 ->assigned_analytical_model_port
*)

solution for scalar port and vector port correct representation
this provides a solution that will allow explicit representation of the structure of a vector port.
It requires that the vector_port be also a subtype of rep_item, specifically a compound_representation_item
where a rule that the type of the compound_representation_item.item_element is a list_representation_item



modified amsp, amvp::

  ENTITY Analytical_model_scalar_port
    SUBTYPE OF (Analytical_model_vector_port);
    WHERE
      WR1 : SIZEOF(SELF\element_port) = 1;
      WR2 : SELF = SELF\analytical_model_vector_port.element_port[1];
  END_ENTITY; -- analytical_model_scalar_port

  ENTITY Analytical_model_vector_port
    SUPERTYPE OF (analytical_model_scalar_port)
    SUBTYPE OF (Analytical_model_port);
    element_port : LIST [1:?] OF analytical_model_scalar_port;
  DERIVE    
      size : INTEGER := SIZEOF(element_port); -- positive_integer;      
  END_ENTITY; -- analytical_model_vector_port

mapping mod::
[analytical_model_vector_port &lt;= representation]
[analytical_model_vector_port &lt;= compound_representation_item]
[compound_representation_item.item_element ->
list_representation_item]

Mapping of 2 Analytical_model_make_from_relationship attributes: reusable_model and resultant_model
have wong declaration. It was written as mapped to Analytical_model, but in ARM EXPRESS type of those 2 attributes is
Analytical_model_definition. So mapping declaration was changed to match the ARM.
