Page 16 section 4.2.4.3 Status
	     The status of an approval is supposed to be "approved" or "not  approved" 
	according to the object description page 16 while page 176 proposes 4 approval 
	status in the AIM: "approved", "not yet approved"; "disapproved" and 
	"withdrawn". 
	
	     Suggested solution:
	     The text page 16 should be changed to be consistent with the AIM.
	     
	     Page 23 section 4.2.19.4 Part_type
	     The description of the possible part_types are not consistent with  what is 
	said page 153. In particular, the "customer supplied material" must be replaced 
	by "customer furnished equipment"; and the part_type value "government" is 
	not existing in the AIM rule of pages 152 and 153. 
	     Suggested solution
	     Modify the text of the section 4.2.19.4 so that it is consistent with the 
	authorized values in pages 152 and 153.
	     
	     Page 36 section 4.3.23 Assertion from Product_configuration to Part. 
	The assertion indicates a relationship from Product_configuration  to Part while 
	it should be from Product_configuration to Part_version. 
	
	     Suggested solution:
	     Change the assertion. The mapping table and the AIM are already reflecting 
	the corrected assertion.
	     
	     Page 54 mapping of Change date 
	     Date_time_role.name ='change_date' is not compliant with the rule 52 
	"restrict_date_time_role" page 186.
	
	     Suggested solution:
	     Modify the role 'change_date' by 'start_date' in the mapping table to be 
	consistent with the rule 52.
	     
	     Page 75 mapping of standard_part_indicator
	     The attribute related_product_category and relating_product_category have 
	been replaced in the entity product_category_relationship by subcategory and 
	category. 
	     Suggested solution:
	     Modify attributes names in the mapping according to the part 41 definition.
	     
	     Page 88 Rule 37
	     The name of the rule 37 is acu_requires_security_classification and not 
	pdu_requires_security_classification as it is written.

   This SEDS was raised against AP203 edition 1 and was closed in edition 2.
   1. Approval status has been made generic, so the terms are not restricted to a particular set.
2. Part is now defined as a subtype of Product, so the mappings and values have changed accordingly
3. The mappings now reflect the new edition of Part41
4. The typo for the rule acu_requries_security_classification has been corrected.
 
The modules affected by this SEDs are:
 
Approval, part_and_version_identification, part_view_definition, and configuration_control_3d_design

This global rule is not sufficient because it 
	allows to create a complex instance of two or several subtypes of 
	shape_representation, provided the items of the representation are only 
	axis2_placement or provided the instance is a representation of a 
	shape_aspect or of a shape_aspect_relationship. 
	
	I think the intent of the protocol (as explicited in the conformance 
	classes) is to allow simple instances of only one of the 7 subtypes of 
	shape_representation. Additionally, the definition of these 7 subtypes 
	is such that they all may contain axis2_placement_3D instances as items. 
	Finally, I do not see why a shape_aspect or a shape_aspect_relationship 
	should be allowed to be represented by a complex instance of several 
	subtypes of shape_representation. Therefore, I consider the rule should 
	be improved.

  Application Assertion 4.3.2, Approval to Person_organization, is not 
	implemented completely in the AIM.  In particular, rules 5.2.4.31, 
	approvals_are_assigned, and 5.2.4.32, 
	approval_requires_approval_person_organization are not sufficient to 
	implement the part of 4.3.2 that asserts "Each Approval is authorized by one or 
	many Person_organization objects."
	
	Since there is no rule requiring person_and_organization to be assigned by 
	person_and_organization_assignment\ 
	cc_design_person_and_organization_assignment, the AIM allows the possibility
	 that a person_and_organization instance associated with a cc_design_approval

  <description>The long form of ISO 10303-203AM1 (WG3N916) includes:

	The same is the case in the IS pdf-file.
	
	However, characterized_product_definition is not used in the long form

	happened during the generation of the long form from the short form
	(WG3N915).
	
	Another however: The pdf-file states in clause 5.2.1.1:
	"The product_definition_shape entity is constrained to use the
	 characterized_product_definition select type."
	This statement seems not to be reflected in the Express schema. The

  <description>Have a look at the type declaration for MONTH_IN_YEAR in the long

	AP214 uses this latter declaration as well.
	
	Semantically the two types are equal. However, should they not also be

<description>
When exchanging shape representation, it would  vastly extend the usability of  
	the information if some basic graphic attributes could be included.    Such 
	inclusions would be used for the CRT display of results, and not for drafting.
	     In addition, many users of CAD systems today use a concept called 
	significant layering.  While this is basically a form of semantic overloading on  
	the CAD system's attribute, it is widely enough used that preserving this option
	 has merit.  Note that this is specifically not a request to include the semantics 
	which various users overload on layers, just to include layers as a graphic 
	attribute which the user can continue to abuse in a way which has  proven useful.

A single conformance class is not useful for implementers.	Develop implementation level modules based upon functional groupings from the high level planning model.  Using the same diagram from the high level planning model, for each implementation module highlight the functional boxes (which are filled with the constituent module names) that belong to that implementation module.

Part 403 claims to define the full information model for 10303-203e2.  Part 1230 and Part 1231 are subsets.
However, the latter references several modules which are not referenced by the complete model defined in Part 403. E.g. Part 1230 references Assembly_structure_arm and Class_arm which are not referenced in Part 403.


Make the module references and the Annexes C of IS0 10303-403, 10303-130 and 10303-1231 consistent
