	<!-- Introduction -->
	<!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
	<purpose>
		<p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of the product definitions with three-dimensional 
     shape representations and the data which defines and controls the configuration of these product definitions for the design life cycle.  
   </p>
	</purpose>
	<!-- Items in scope -->
	<inscope>
		<li>Products that are mechanical parts and assemblies;</li>
		<li>Product definition data and configuration control data pertaining to the design phase of a product's development;</li>
		<li>Representation of an instance of a part in an assembly through its usage in a sub-assembly;</li>
		<li>Six groups of shape representations of a part that includes advanced boundary representation,  faceted boundary representation,  
       manifold surfaces with topology, geometrically bounded surface and wireframe geometry,  wireframe with topology, and constructive solid geometry in three-dimensions;</li>
		<li>Geometric validation properties to allow the translation of geometric shape representations (advanced boundary representation and 
       faceted boundary representation solids) to be checked for quality;</li>
		<li>Geometric presentation of geometric shape representations by the application of colours, layers and groups;</li>
		<li>Geometric and dimensional tolerances applied to geometric shape representations;</li>
		<li>Textual annotation and notes applied to geometric shape representations.</li>
	</inscope>
	<!-- Items out of scope -->
	<outscope>
		<li>Business data for management of a design project;</li>	
		<li>Data that results in change to the design during the initial design evolution prior to release;</li>
		<li>Product definition data and configuration control data pertaining to any life cycle phase other than design.</li>
	</outscope>
