 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     
This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application protocol (AP) for the exchange of computer-interpretable composite and metallic
structural product definitions, including product shape, associated finite element analysis (FEA) models
and analysis results, and the material properties of these products.
</p><p>
The shape of a composite or metallic product definition includes the part and its constituents, including
any ply shapes necessary for FEA node and mesh generation of boundary definitions. This information
is suitable for the automated generation of composite material properties and geometric properties for
finite elements. The shape definitions for design and analysis are each independently configuration
controlled.
</p>
<p>
The finite element model idealizes a product or aspects of a product so that it may be analyzed to validate
the structural performance and structural integrity of a product.Finite elements of homogenous (isotropic) metallic and adhesive material properties are treated in this
part of ISO 10303 as a subset of anisotropic composite material response. The differences between these
two material response idealizations are: 1) a simplified material response, and 2) having no associated
composite constituent information.</p><p>

Assembly information provides the relationships necessary to identify analysis boundary conditions, and
when combined with part geometry, topology, and finite element analysis output, provides the input
necessary for detail analyses such as those for fastened structural joints.
This part of ISO 10303 satisfies the need for exchange of information between the iterative design and
analysis stages of the product life cycle. Product configuration information provides the audit trail
necessary to control the designed shape, its associated finite element model, and any related analysis
shape information during these iterative stages of the product life cycle.
This application protocol defines the context, scope, and information requirements for the exchange of
the information necessary to perform the design through analysis stages of the life cycle of composite
and metallic structural parts, and specifies the integrated resources necessary to satisfy these
requirements.
</p>
<p>Changes in this document include increased integration with other parts of ISO 10303 because of its migration to the modular architecture. Additionally, new capabilities have been added. The second Edition of ISO 10303-209 (AP209) has integrated a generic Engineering Analysis capability complimented by specific CFD and generalized mesh based numerical analysis capabilities to the AP209 Edition 1 classical Finite Element Analysis capabilities. The CFD capability is based upon the NASA/AIAA CGNS standard and the Volvo Aero EAR-model work. The generalized structured and unstructured analysis and mesh capabilities are based upon work done in the Generic Engineering Analysis Model (GEM) project from the European Union. In addition there is a complete discrete/continuous mathematical field representation capability that has been added based upon the David Taylor Labs/Boeing DT-NURBS package. All of these added capabilities have been integrated into the ISO 10303 common resources Parts 10303-50, 10303-51, 10303-52, 10303-53, 10303-107, and 10303-110 as a basis for use in Application Protocols. The intent is that AP209E2 will now address a much wider set of multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization problems.</p>
