    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of assembly physical design.
This data includes all data that defines the physical relationships between the components in the
assembly. This data includes all the components that exist in the assembly, and specifies those
that provide physical interfaces to the next level of assembly. Several types of assembly joint
may be specified. Design re-use is explicitly supported with traceability. Complete traceability
back to requirements is provided. This data identifies those components that do not meet design
requirements. Appropriate elements of Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing are provided.
This data includes both design view and usage view of the assembly. Configuration management
information and design management information is provided. This data includes at least one
geometric representation.
