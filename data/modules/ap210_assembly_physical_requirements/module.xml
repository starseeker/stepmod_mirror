    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of assembly physical requirements.
This Data includes all information provided to the design team that may be represented by
shape data, including customer requirements, and technology selected to implement those requirements.
Explicit allowed volumetric shape, external connection locations are included. Component
grouping, keepout, keepin, etc is included. This data includes information required to
support embedded components in an interconnect product. Configuration management information
and design management information is provided. Preferred parts and packages may be
specified by inclusion in design library. This data includes at least one geometric representation.
