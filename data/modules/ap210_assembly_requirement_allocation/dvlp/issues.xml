Is this module necessary? The intro states that it is a superset of all the other ap210_assembly_xxx_requirements.
If the intro is correct, the scope, keywords, and USE_FROMs need to be updated.

This module represents cc 33 of the IS version (see below).
I don't have the full overview to say what is needed here or not.
Comparing with old cc 33 I can say that these USE FROMS are needed.

SCHEMA Ap210_assembly_requirement_allocation_arm;
 USE FROM ap210_product_data_management_arm;
 USE FROM characteristic_arm;
 USE FROM Analytical_model_arm;
 USE FROM Assembly_functional_interface_requirement_arm;
 USE FROM Assembly_physical_interface_requirement_arm
 USE FROM Assembly_physical_requirement_allocation_arm
 ...

-----------------

6.33 Assembly Requirement Allocation
Assembly Requirement Allocation includes the following information: complete functional and
physical interface requirements, complete capability to allocate enterprise or external agency
requirements to assembly function or physical design, model based requirement description using
simulation models and models with assigned parametric data. Supporting data including
documetn, authorization, product identification, external definition, and authorization are included.
The class requires the implementation of the following Units of Functionality:
 analytical model;
 analytical representation;
 assembly functional interface requirement;
 assembly functional requirement allocation;
 assembly physical interface requirement;
 assembly physical requirement allocation;
 authorization;
 characteristic;
 document;
 end item identification;
 external definition.
