    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of device functional and physical characterization.
Device Data includes following information: device black box model, package data, functional
data, environmental constraints, performance data, simulation models. Formal encapsulation of
external data type definitions is made for parametric data and analysis models. Pin mapping
is provided to ensure consistency between device views. Shape, material, technology, tolerance
on shape and on parameters, units are included. Shapes included may be categorized according
to discipline (e.g. thermal analysis, vibration analysis), and analysis environment (e.g., design,
assembly, end-user). Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing is included. The functional
data includes two distinct data sets: hierarchical functional decomposition into behavioural
elements embedded in a network represented at each level by a nodal formulation; collection of
device terminals (e.g., connector terminals, printed circuit board interface areas, jumper ends)
that implement the functionality of a network node. Configuration management information
and design management information is provided. This data includes at least one geometric
representation.
