    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of design and application of electrical and electrotechnical components and assemblies.  Included are capabilities to represent the various requirements and sources levied on these items, as well as constraints arising from manufacturing processes. Network analysis of proposed or actual design is supported, as is applications that map from the network listing to the layout.  Two dimensional and three dimensional assembly and interconnect design is supported, as is microwave and embedded design.
   </p>
