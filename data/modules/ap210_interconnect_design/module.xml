    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of interconnect design.
This data provides functional and physical layout information sufficient to allow manufacture and
test of an interconnect. Design re-use is explicitly supported with traceability. Complete traceability
back to requirements is provided. Product connection requirements, shape requirements,
product specifications, process specifications, material specifications including manufacturing
view of stackup, Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing are provided. This data identifies
those elements that do not meet design requirements. This data includes both design view
and usage view of the interconnect product. Support for specification of signal prioritization is
provided. Support for specifying the explicit network topology to be implemented is provided.
Configuration management information and design management information is provided. This
data includes at least one geometric representation.
