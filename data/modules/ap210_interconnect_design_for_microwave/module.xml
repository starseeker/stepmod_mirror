    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of interconnect design for microwave.
This data is similar to Class 9, with the exception that the metallization may be considered
to be microstrip or stripline, with a specified shape element of the cross-section(i.e., point,
edge, cutting plane) acting as the terminal(terminal pair, port) of the line or component. Use
of formal external definitions is provided to link in models with the product definition data.
Analytical model terminals may be typed as having distributed parameters. This data identifies
those elements that do not meet design requirements. This data includes both design view
and usage view of the interconnect product. Support for specification of signal prioritization is
provided. Support for specifying the explicit network topology to be implemented is provided.
Configuration management information and design management information is provided. This
data includes at least one geometric representation.
