    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of interconnect functional requirements.
This Data includes the device data from conformance class 1 (only the functional device information)
specific to an interconnect product (e.g., pcb, substrate, flex board). The functional
view of Devices which are fabricated as part of the interconnect product fabrication process (
e.g., printed inductors, printed connectors, printed capacitors) are included in the functional definition.
Devices which are embedded are considered to be external to the interconnect product
since they are not fabricated as part of the product and their shape does not directly contribute
to the shape definition of the interconnect product. Configuration management information and
design management information is provided.
