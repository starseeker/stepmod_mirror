    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of interconnect physical requirements.
This Data includes all information related to shape and position requirements. Trace, via and
other passage spacing, keepin, keepout, etc. is included. Explicit allowed volumetric shape, required
connection locations, material specifications, etc. are included. Those layout items whose
placement is driven by thermal considerations or electromagnetic interference may be specified.
Configuration management information and design management information is provided. This
data includes at least one geometric representation.
