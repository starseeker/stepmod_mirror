    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of package functional and physical characterization.
Package Data includes following information: Case style, material identification, environmental
constraints, performance data, simulation models. Formal encapsulation of external data type
definitions is made for parametric data and analysis models. Terminal identification is provided
to ensure consistency between 2D and 3D geometric models. Package body material is included.
Terminals may have core and surface materials. Shape, material, technology, tolerance on
shape and on parameters, units are included. Extensive support for orientation synchronization
between enterprises is provided. Shapes included may be categorized according to discipline
(e.g, thermal analysis, vibration analysis), and analysis environment (e.g., assembly, end-user).
Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing is included. Complex packages may be treated by
the design owner as an interconnect product and publish the information in package as the
customer view. Formal Reference information to a defining document is provided. Configuration
management information and design management information is provided. This data includes
at least one geometric representation.
