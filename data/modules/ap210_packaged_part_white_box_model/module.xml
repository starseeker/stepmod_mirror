    <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of packaged part white box model.
Packaged Part White Box Model Data includes following information: device model, package
data, functional data, environmental constraints, performance data, simulation models. Assembly
arrangement of devices included in the package to compose the packaged part is expliclty
provided. Mapping of analysis model connection points to package terminals is provided. Formal
encapsulation of external data type definitions is made for parametric data and analysis
models. Pin mapping is provided to ensure consistency between device views. Shape, material,
technology, tolerance on shape and on parameters, units are included. Shapes included may
be categorized according to discipline (e.g. thermal analysis, vibration analysis), and analysis
environment (e.g., design, assembly, end-user). Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing is
included. The functional data includes two distinct data sets: hierarchical functional decomposition
into behavioural elements embedded in a network represented at each level by a nodal
formulation; collection of device terminals (e.g., connector terminals, printed circuit board interface
areas, jumper ends) that implement the functionality of a network node. Configuration
management information and design management information is provided. This data includes
at least one geometric representation.
