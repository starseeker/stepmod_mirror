<abstract>
	<p>
		the
     representation of printed part functional and physical characterization.
Printed Part Data includes following information: device model, layout template data, functional
data, environmental constraints, performance data, simulation models. Sufficient data is provided for product
	   realization as part of a higher level interconnect realization process.  Mapping of analysis
model connection points to printed part terminals is provided. Formal encapsulation of external
data type definitions is made for parametric data and analysis models. Pin mapping is provided
to ensure consistency between device views. Shape, material, technology, tolerance on shape and
on parameters, units are included. Shapes included may be categorized according to discipline
(e.g. thermal analysis, vibration analysis), and analysis environment (e.g., design, assembly, enduser).
Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing is included. The functional data includes two
distinct data sets: hierarchical functional decomposition into behavioural elements embedded
in a network represented at each level by a nodal formulation; collection of device terminals
that implement the functionality of a network node. Configuration management information
and design change management information is provided. This data includes at least one geometric
representation.
