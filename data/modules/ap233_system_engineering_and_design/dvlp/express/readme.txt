This directory is a working directory used to store temporary EXPRESS files 
needed during the short to long form conversion.

the EXPRESS of all of the modules into a single file for compilation or
the short to long form conversion.

To extract all the ARM EXPRESS, list the modules in arm_modlist.txt

To extract all the ARM EXPRESS, list the modules in mim_modlist.txt and the
