 <purpose>
  <p>
    This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
    representation of the variety of general model classifications used to
    support model based systems engineering.  This includes all models used to
    characterize the physical structure and its behavior and the full range of
    models used to support system engineering trade studies.
  </p> 
  <p>
    This module is the top level application module for AP233.  It brings
    together the system modelling capabilities and the program management 
    capabilities.  As such, the variety of modeling paradigms used to 
    represent the physical and functional system and capabilites used 
    to support associated verification, validation and trade studies as well
    as the program managment activities of systems engineering.

    <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of systems engineering.</p>
     
   <p>This part of ISO 10303 uses the set of application modules
      for product data management information (the "PDM Modules"). These are
      based on the "PDM Schema" <a href="http://www.pdm-if.org/pdm_schema/"/> that was developed to 
      achieve harmonization between application protocols ISO 10303-203, ISO
      10303-214 and ISO 10303-232.</p>
      
   <p>This part of ISO 10303 has its conceptual base founded in "Concept model" that can be 
   downloaded at
   <a href="http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/Concept_Model.ppt?revision=1.1"/>.
   and its companion semantic dictionary can be downloaded at
   <a href="http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/Concept_Model_Semantic_Dictionary.xls?revision=1.1"/>.
   
   </p>
   <p>These two interwoven documents have been extensively reviewed by the ISO 
   AP233 development team, members of the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) and
   members of the Object Managemement Groups (OMG).  The work was performed via the the leadership efforts of
   INCOSE's Model Driven Design working group
   <a href="http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/modelingtools/mdsdwg.aspx/"/>.  
   This group has, in its efforts to extend best practices of System Engineering into softwere engineeering succeed 
   in initiating the SysML project within the OMG and assisting with that activity. The home page for the SysML 
   partners is <a href="http://www.sysml.org"/>. The memo of uncderstanding between the 2 groups (INCOSE and OMG) 
   can be downloaded at:
   <a href="http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/OMG-INCOSE-MOU.doc"/>.
   </p>
   
   <p>In mid 2005 AP233 Working draft 1 (AP233-WD1) was delivered.  Basically is captured all that was needed for AP233
   from the perspective of a systems engineer.  Since delivery the STEP/EXPRESS modeling expert 
   arm of the AP233 team has been enhancing and restructuring AP233 WD1. The net result is the current 
   product that is much better from the perspective of "information modelling"; however, much more 
   difficult to penetrate from the perspective of a systems engineer.</p>
   
   <p>The following few paragraphs attempt to bridge the gap by tracing ap233's evolution and maing
   appropriate connects to current AP233 modules used.</p>
   
   <p>The following 2 figures provide a very high level over view of AP233 WD1 from an organizational and 
   application points of view:   </p>
		<figure> <title>AP233 module organization</title>
			<img src="Slide1.gif"/>	
	</figure>
		<figure> <title>AP233 module application </title>
			<img src="Slide2.gif"/>	
	</figure>

   <p>Figure 3 provides a concept map AP233 as it is presented herein</p>
   
   	<figure> <title>AP233_arm_Concept_Map</title>
			<img src="AP233_arm_Concept_Map.gif"/>	
	</figure>
	
   <p>Relative to Figure 3, the top level modules that enable all of AP233's current capapbility 
   are listed below.  Within each see Annex F for additional discussion and follow hyperlinks
   provided down to the most atomic level of detail:</p>
   <ul>
   <li><module_ref linkend="decision_support:introduction"/>;</li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="function_based_behaviour:introduction"/>;</li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="issue_management:introduction"/>;</li>

   <li><module_ref linkend="system_structure:introduction"/>;</li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="work_structure:introduction"/>. </li>
   </ul>

   <p>It should be rather evident from a comparison between Figures 1 and 3 that there has been 
   significant box rearrangement but content has been altered.  A few not so obvous points need to be 
   pointed out.</p>
   
   <ul>
   <li>The information model is now partitioned into a program management arm and a system 
   modelling arm.</li>
   <li>In AP233 WD1 "system of systems" is identified.  This is now all covered within the "System
   structure arm".</li>
   <li>In AP233 WD1 many boxes are labeled "connector".  The function that these boxes enabled is now 
   hidden but enabled via the EXPRESS model Extensible SELECT TYPE capability.</li>
   <li>Figure 2 attempts to show system engineering information modelling connectivity steming
   from the systems engineer's need to satisfy requirements and enable interfaces.
   Much of this work is also hidden but enabled via the EXPRESS model Extensible SELECT TYPE 
   capability.
   </li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>The subject domains of validation, verification, test and measurement are covered 
   in the concept model. Included within this work is the subject of "issues".  A number of 
   early attempts to define and bound this module have been made.  The collected notes on this 
   subject can be downloaded at
   <a href="http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/system_management/Issue%20module%20collected%20notes.ppt?revision=1.1"/>.  </p>
   
   <p>The inital ideas for the system of systems work noted in AP233 WD1 and enabled herein 
   can be found in Chapter 15 of David Oliver's book "Engineering 
   Complex Systems with Models and Objects".  This can be freely downloaded at 
   <a href="http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/system_engineering/Engineering%20Complex%20Systems%20%28book%29.pdf?revision=1.1"/>.
   </p>

   <p>The AP233 WD1 team has most assuredly <b>missed concepts</b> within its Concept model and all that has been 
   inferred from it.  Fortunately documents that reflect a generation of experience supporting 
   real world projects exists.  The following work has been used to guide various aspects of current work.</p>

   <p>The first is 
   Vitech Corp's.<a href="http://www.vitechcorp.com/"/> schema for their CORE software product.
   This can be downloaded at 
   <a href="http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/system_engineering/Vitech%20Corp%20CORE%20Schema.zip?revision=1.1"/>.  
   This schema has grown through a generation of system engineering customer support.</p>

   <p>The second is the 
   Department of Defense (US) Architectural framework (DoDAF). The following DoD reference source material
   can be downloaded as a single zip file from:
   <a href="http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/system_engineering/DoDAF%20architecture.zip?revision=1.1"/> </p><ol>
   <li>The DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) Version 1.0 (.pdf)  Memorandum by John P. Stenbit, February 9, 2004. 
   The DoDAF Version 1.0 defines a common approach for DoD architecture description, development, presentation, and 
   integration for both warfighting operations and business processes. The DoDAF Version 1.0 supersedes the C4ISR 
   Architecture Framework, Version 2.0 dated December 18, 1997. The DoDAF Version 1.0 is partitioned into two 
   volumes and a deskbook - see links provided directly below:</li>
   <li>DoDAF Version 1.0 - Volume I (.pdf) Provides 
   definitions, guidelines, background material.  </li>
   <li>DoDAF Version 1.0 - Volume II (.pdf) Describes each architecture 
   product.</li>
   <li>DoDAF Version 1.0 - Deskbook (.pdf) Provides supplementary "how to" information relating to 
   architectures.</li></ol>
   
       <p>NOTE: The full set of entities and relationships that exist in tools in use are in scope; while the 
   relationships identified as out of scope are unbounded, unknown, and not possible to establish.
   </p>

   <p>At the ISO SC4 STEP meeting in Hanzhou China Oct 2005 there was an detail review of AP233 WD1.  This 
   work, with minimal modification, has laid the foundationn for all that is included herein.  
   These notes follow:</p>
   
   <p><b>Begin - Notes from SC4 Meeting in Hangzhou and post meeting email exchanges</b></p>
   
   <p>Re. <i>Top level organization</i> - The top level organization of AP233 needs to be changed 
   to become more consistent with good information modeling practice.  The vision is to have 
   2 second tier modules namely:</p>
   <ol><li>USE FROM Project_management_arm;</li>
   <li>USE FROM System_modelling_arm;</li></ol>
   
   <p>Both of these 2 send tier modules make use of the set set of common product data management 
   capabilities as provided in setpmod; namely:</p>
      <ol><li>USE FROM Product_data_management_arm;</li></ol>
      <note>There are a number of stepmod modules that AP233 needs to view as being part of 
      product data management and available for use by the 2 second tier modules.  
      For example: <ol>    
          <li>USE FROM Experience_arm;</li>
          <li>USE FROM Information_product_arm;</li>
          <li>USE FROM Information_rights_arm;</li>
	  <li>USE FROM Justification_arm;</li>
          <li>USE FROM Organization_type_arm;</li>
          <li>USE FROM Position_in_organization_arm;</li>
          <li>USE FROM Qualifications_arm;</li>
          <li>USE FROM Type_of_person_arm;</li></ol>
	  How and where these and other needed-by-all modules get inserted into the 
	  schema framework is to be determined.
	  </note>


   <p>The Project_management_arm will support all system engineering management activities and 
   the System_modelling_arm; will cover all system modeling and engineering activities.  </p>

   <p>Re. <i>Breakdown organization</i> - The underlying logic controlling schema breakdown will be based upon Implementation Modules (IM's)</p>

   <p>The Project_management_arm module will contain the USE FROM's that support</p>
   <ol><li>Product data management</li>
   <li>PDM Extra stuff (e.g., justification, information rights, etc.)</li>
   <li>Schedule and work (with cost included) as a single Implementation Module (IM)</li>
   <li>Issue management</li>
   <li>Risk management</li>
   </ol>
   
  <p>The System_modelling_arm module will contain the USE FROM's that support</p>
   <ol><li>System behavior (Function + State based behavior)</li>
   <li>System structure (Breakdown + Interface)</li>
   <li>Requirements management (Text + Property based)</li>
   <li>Trade study</li>
   <li>Verification and validation, etc.</li></ol>
   
   <p>Re. <i>Type Extends</i> - The series of connector modules xxxx_connector identified in WD#1 will change.  Associated detail is 
   is work in progress.  The underlying plcs logic will be followed so as to maximize reuse.  
   We need to make use of work_xxxx_characterized modules.  These will require use of 
   ap239_management_resource_information and ap239_properties.  Signficant type extending 
   exists in AP239 in the IM modules AP239_xxxx.  These cannot be used directly; however 
   they provide some guidance on type extending.</p>
   
   
   <p>Re. <i>Reference data</i> - Detail is still to be determined.  Guidance - Reference data 
   standardized in AP233 must be identified in a Conformance Clause within the AP document.  
   A way forward has been outlined.  From a user perspective:  Any organization is free to 
   categorize as then need.  Reference data can be used to provide associated definitions.</p>
   
   <p>The following Part 28 example was provided to explain essence of methodology</p>
   
   <p><b>#1=Requirement(______)</b></p>
   <p><b>#2=External_class('Functional Requirement','ISO 10303-233:REFLIB')</b></p>
   <note>ISO 10303-233 is where the AP233 reference library is located.</note>
   <p><b>#3=Classification_assignment(#1,#2)</b></p>
   <p><b>#31=Requirement(______)</b></p>
   <p><b>#32=External_class('Strategic Requirement','MOD:REFLIB')</b></p>
   <note>MOD is where the Ministry of Defence reference library is located.</note>
   <p><b>#33=Classification_assignment(#31,#32)</b></p>

   
   <p>Re. <i>Scope clause</i> - Need to rewrite Scope statements</p>

   
   <p>Re. <i>Technical plan</i> - The following provides a few top level notes relative to 
   line items in the technical plan agreed to in HangZhou</p>
   <ol>
   <li>Interface Arm or AP210 Interface - AP233 is to use the AP239 interface arm.
   Need to map to SysML, AP210 and DoDAF, need to harmonize 3 approaches.</li>
   <li>Reorganize top level Modules - Work has begun, see above notes.</li>
   <li>System Module - There's a need for the module "System_and_version_identification_arm".  
   This was pulled from the Attic, put back in stepmod and then update by Phil.  We may need 
   a few more clone's of this.</li>
   <li>Breakdown Arms - These, as defined by AP239 are being used.  Needed fixes to WD#1 have 
   been done.  </li>
   <li>Requirement Subclasses arm - Two views of the problem are finally understood. 
   Creation of the associated detail is now work in progress.</li>
   <li>SE Breakdown - Done, removed from WD#1.</li>
   <li>Requirement external classification - Need now to complete the detail needed to support
   external class approach.  See Part 28 example above.</li>
   <li>Approach for standardized AP233 reference data - Once detail defined where do we put it.
   Enter Allison, guidance needed.</li>
  <li>Requirement model assignment - Need to do the external class stuff first</li>
  <li>Requirement classification Module - Need to align with external class stuff.  
  Phil says its done and there's no problem.  Need to prepare associated documentation 
  and work through all detail.</li>
  <li>Measures of Effectiveness - Problem seems to be fianally understood by all.  
  Included in the new Trade_study arm.</li>
  <li>FBB Module Set - Phil is to provide significant rework of the WD#1 set of modules.  
  Inputs from Erik will be sought.  Also there is desire to align with work being done by SBB.
  Seems that there will be a need for more external class stuff to be defined so as to insure 
  that the execution of the models exchanged will agree - a critical need.  Will attack 
  this after requirments external class work finished.  Methodology to be used will be the same.</li>
  <li>SBB Module Set - Work proceeding via David Price.  Module has been posted in stepmod.</li>
  <li>Verification and validation - Phil to follow up via Vivace project.</li>
  <li>Analysis- Phil to follow up with Harry's draft work on analysis in support of decision making 
  via Vivace project.</li>
   </ol>
