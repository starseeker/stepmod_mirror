 <abstract>
    <li>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of 
    systems engineering.  It collects all AP233 work currently envisioned for AP233 Edition 1.  
    It is used to collect all work that is mature enough for technical discussions based upon 
    proposed EXPRESS-G/EXPRESS models.  It is expected that harmonization discussions 
    will lead to module name changing and/or new additions to existing stepmod modules.
    It is also expected that proposed modules defined herein will be restructured to follow 
    better ideas revealed during technical review.  Some exisitng stepmod modules are 
    stong candiates for reuse; however, subtle ramifications must be explored in depth. 
    Technical discussion may lead either to a new edition of an existing module, an extension 
    module or a new module.  As modules under discussion mature to a reasonable level of name 
    and function stability they transition into the stepmod repository. The module 
    <module_ref linkend="ap233_system_engineering_and_design:introduction"/> contains 
    all AP233 test ready work.

     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of systems engineering.</p>
     
    <p> This module collects all AP233 work currently envisioned for AP233 Edition 1.  
    It is used to collect all work that is mature enough for technical discussions based upon 
    proposed EXPRESS-G/EXPRESS models.  It is expected that harmonization discussions 
    will lead to module name changing and/or new additions to existing stepmod modules.
    It is also expected that proposed modules defined herein will be restructured to follow 
    better ideas revealed during technical review.  Some exisitng stepmod modules are 
    stong candiates for reuse; however, subtle ramifications must be explored in depth. 
    Technical discussion may lead either to a new edition of an existing module, an extension 
    module or a new module.  As modules under discussion mature to a reasonable level of name 
    and function stability they are moved into the stepmod repository. The module 
    <module_ref linkend="ap233_system_engineering_and_design:introduction"/> contains all AP233 test ready work.

   <p>This part of ISO 10303 uses the set of application modules
      for product data management information (the "PDM Modules"). These are
      based on the "PDM Schema" <a href="http://www.pdm-if.org/pdm_schema/"/> that was developed to achieve
      harmonization between application protocols ISO 10303-203, ISO
      10303-214 and ISO 10303-232.</p>
      
   <p>This part of ISO 10303 has its conceptual base founded in "Concept model" that can be 
   downloaded at
   <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/Concept_Model.ppt?rev=1.1"/>.
   and its companion semantic dictionary can be downloaded at
   <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/Concept_Model_Semantic_Dictionary.xls?rev=1.1"/>.and 
   </p>
   <p>These two interwoven documents have been extensively reviewed by the ISO 
   AP233 development team, members of the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) and
   members of the Object Managemement Groups (OMG).  The work was performed via the the leadership efforts of
   INCOSE's Model Driven Design working group
   <a href="http://www.incose.org/practice/techactivities/modelingtools/mdsdwg.aspx/"/>.  
   This group has, in its efforts to extend best practices of System Engineering into softwere engineeering succeed 
   in initiating the SysML project within the OMG and assisting with that activity. The home page for the SysML 
   partners is <a href="http://www.sysml.org"/>. The memo of uncderstanding between the 2 groups (INCOSE and OMG) 
   can be downloaded at:
   <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/OMG-INCOSE-MOU.doc?rev=1.1"/>.
