 <purpose>
  <p>
    This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
    representation of the variety of general model classifications used to
    support model based systems engineering.  This includes all models used to
    characterize the physical structure and its behavior and the full range of
    models used to support systems engineering trade studies.
  </p> 
  
  <p>
    This module <b>ISO/CD-TS 10303-433 Application module: AP233 systems engineering </b>
    is the top level application module for AP233.  It brings
    together the system modelling capabilities and the program management 
    capabilities.  As such, the variety of modeling paradigms used to 
    represent the physical and functional system and capabilities used 
    to support associated verification, validation and trade studies as well
    as the program management activities of systems engineering.
   </p>
  
  <note>The following overview text <b>What Sytems Engineering Is</b> repeats the introductory 
  text of <b> ISO/CD 10303-233 Application protocol: Systems engineering.</b> 
  Additional overview material and an Ap233 documentation guide to all relevant 
  ISO 10303 appplication modules is provided therein.</note> 
  
  <note>ISO 10303 documentation rules prohibit hyperlinks from application modules to 
  application protocols.</note>

   <p><b>What systems engineering is</b></p>

   <p>Systems Engineering is <i>An interdisciplinary collaborative approach to derive, evolve, 
   and verify a life cycle balanced system solution that satisfies customer expectations and 
   meets public acceptability.</i> (IEEE 1220-1984) </p>

   <p><i>Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization 
   of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early 
   in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and 
   system validation while considering the complete problem.</i> (INCOSE)</p>

   <p>The complete problem spans:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>stakeholder needs;</li>
   <li>requirements;</li>
   <li>the enterprise and competitors;</li>
   <li>concept;</li>
   <li>design;</li>
   <li>design optimization by trade studies;</li>
   <li>design validation and verification;</li>
   <li>manufacture;</li>
   <li>product validation and verification;</li>
   <li>test;</li>
   <li>maintenance;</li>
   <li>disposal;</li>
   <li>training and support;</li>
   <li>cost and schedule;</li>
   <li>program management.</li>
   </ul>

   <p><i>Systems Engineering integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort 
   forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. 
   Systems Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with 
   the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs.</i> (INCOSE)</p>
   
   <p>Systems Engineering makes extensive use of specification of all interfaces, performance 
   analysis, and trade studies to ensure that the system is near optimal for and will be accepted 
   by stakeholders and the marketplace. It is applicable to anything for which a well defined 
   boundary can be established whether mechanical, electrical, electronic, information, chemical, 
   biological, social or organizational.</p>
   
   <p><b>What Ap233 is</b></p>
   
   <p>Ap233 is an information model that captures the concepts used in Systems Engineering, as 
   <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:introduction:figure:se1:1">Figure 1</module_ref> shows. 
   These concepts may be represented by a variety of symbols and each set of such 
   symbols can be combined into an number of different views. A particular set of symbols and views 
   constitutes a language. Tools automate the use of such a language to represent and model systems. 
   For any language a number of different tools may exist and they may not be able to exchange data 
   even using the same language unless they have compatible schema for storing that language. Thus a 
   single set of concepts results in a plethora of languages and tools.</p>

		<figure id="se1" number="1"> 
		<title>AP233 Information model</title>
			<img src="Slide9.gif"/>	
		</figure>

		
    <p>The tools are used by engineers. Frequently it is the organization that establishes the process, 
    a specification of the views and development order that shall be followed, that the engineers 
    shall follow. Two organizations using the same tool may or may not use equivalent views in doing 
    their work.</p>

    <p>In general there is no single tool that can support all the work that must be done so the 
    tools are most efficient when put in an environment that enables them to exchange the information 
    artifacts that the engineers produce using the tools. Often different tools incorporated in a 
    single environment cannot exchange information. Very often the organizations in a supply chain 
    or working together on a single project as a consortium will have different environments 
    incorporating different sets of tools. Yet all members of the supply chain or consortium need 
    to efficiently share data rigorously and at low cost.</p>

    <p>The application protocol, like AP233 for Systems Engineering, provides a solution to this 
    problem. Each tool needs an interface that interconnects the tool with the AP. The interface 
    transforms the data artifacts from the tool for correct storage in the AP and transforms data 
    supplied by the AP for use by the tool.</p>

    <p>In this way AP233 supports information exchange among organizations even though their 
    environments contain different tools.  AP233 is the glue for organizations working together 
    in a consortium or a supplier chain.</p>
    
   <p><b>What Ap233 contains</b></p>
   
   <p><module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:introduction:figure:se2:2">Figure 2</module_ref> shows. 
   shows the basic capabilities of AP233. It is divided into two main parts, Program 
   Management and System Requirements/Design. Major capabilities are listed in each box. The 
   relevant kinds of tools that are applicable surround each box. The two main parts of the work 
   are interconnected by risk analysis, issue resolution, and management authorization and review. 
   Where these capabilities share concepts, i.e. where they are semantically equivalent, there can 
   be exchange of information artifacts among any of the tools through the tool interfaces and the 
   AP233 information model.</p>


		<figure id="se2" number="2"> 
		<title>AP233 content and associated tools</title>
		<img src="Slide10.gif"/>	
		</figure>

   <p>The same transfer is possible where there is semantic identity with downstream design, 
   manufacture, test, and maintenance tools. There are many ISO 10303 Application Protocols 
   (AP’s) for a variety of industrial businesses such as, geometry, circuit board and chip 
   development, ship building, building construction, furniture design and manufacture, maintenance, 
   etc.  A large number of different tools are used by these businesses and interface through their 
   own AP’s. All of these AP’s have been made modular and share, as much as possible, the same modules 
   This approach is vital for connecting systems engineering tools to downstream tools and it makes 
   possible the use of AP233 as an integrating AP across all the others.</p>

   <p>The shared modularity has also required that the AP233 modules use naming conventions that 
   were developed a decade or more ago by developers in other disciplines. The consequence is that 
   AP233 contains names in the detailed EXPRESS code that will seem foreign to practicing systems 
   engineers. It also means that many modules will use a different common module for widely needed 
   representation of entities like number or a weighting factor. Thus the reader who looks at a 
   particular module may not see there an entity that he knows belongs there because it resides 
   in a shared module and is connected to the module he is reading. Efficient use of the EXPRESS 
   language also means that the connection to the common module may go through a chain of classes 
   and subclasses; it may be very indirect for the reader. </p>

   <p>For the reasons above, this introduction does not attempt to show the reader the details of 
   the EXPRESS code. Rather this introduction attempts to: </p>
	<ol>
	<li>describe AP233 as a container of concepts shared by tools; </li>
	<li>list number of the Ap233 capabilities; </li>
	<li>show kinds of tools that can interface with one another through AP233;</li>
	<li>show the major mappings of capabilities onto the modules that constitute the information module.</li>
	</ol>

   <p>Those who wish to investigate the modules in detail can use this Introduction as a guide to 
   that adventure. 
   <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:introduction:figure:se3:3">Figure 3</module_ref> shows. 
   shows a top-level view of the module hierarchy. It is important to be 
   aware that the boxes under a higher box do not necessarily completely compose it. Rather there 
   may be additional things in the box above. This is not intuitive to those accustomed to hardware 
   development, but it is a result of the software languages.</p>

   <p>The capabilities of Figure 2. map into modules of Figure 3. as identified below. Be 
   aware that these are not leaf cell modules. There may be structure below them, and they may 
   connect to modules above and below through type extensions. This makes reading the code or 
   the graphic EXPRESS-G diagrams difficult, but it is the nature of the language. </p>

   <def>
     that which is discernable by the reproducible measurement of its characteristics
     <note>The semantic term element includes matter, energy and information.  The term 
     product from ISO 10303-Part 1 STEP definitions defines product as: a thing or 
     substance produced by a natural or artificial process. This part of ISO 10303 
     needs to define the informational attributes associated with the entity named 
     "product" as defined within ISO 10303-1017 - Product Identification. This entity 
     has attributes that enable one to capture: id, name and description.  ISO 10303-1017 
     provides the definition: A Product is the identification of a product or of a type 
     of product. It is a collector of data common to all revisions of the product. Element 
     appears to be a legitimate subclass of product because this part requires reproducible 
     measurement of element.</note>
     <example>Any thing from microscopic particles to galaxy clusters is an element.  
     Any thing with a finite existence from galaxies with billion-year lives to trans-uranic 
     elements with lifetimes less than nano-seconds. Counter-example: Things like ghosts, 
     devils, the Loch Ness monster, the city of Atlantis are not discernable by reproducible 
     measurement and are excluded. Research and development things that do not yet have 
     reproducible measurements and process control are excluded. For example, silicon for 
     electronic devices would be excluded in 1900. </example>

   <def>
     categories provide the grouping of elements into a set based on defined 
     properties that serve as selection criteria for which elements of all those
     in the universe belong in that set
     <note>This is one of the forms of generalization/specialization. This is 
     <b>not inheritance</b> as used in object-oriented software languages. Physical 
     elements of matter and energy do not inherit their properties. Rather they posses 
     the properties of themselves and can be identified by measurement of those properties.</note>
     
     <example>Explanation: It is categorization that enables us to define alternatives 
     and create taxonomies for libraries. </example>
     <ul>
     <li>Inclusive/Complete Category: Any Element of the super category may 
     reside in any number of the sub-categories and all members of the super-category 
     are members of at least one of the sub-categories.</li></ul>
     <example>the super category is all apples raised on a particular farm. The subcategories 
     are used for sorting and include: good apples, bruised apples, marked apples, rotten 
     apples, and wormy apples.</example>
     <ul>
     <li>Inclusive/Incomplete Category: Any Element of the super category may reside in any 
     number of the sub-categories and only some members of the super-category are members 
     of the sub-categories.</li></ul>
     <example>the super category is all fruit raised on a particular farm. The subcategories 
     are used for sorting and include: good apples, bruised apples, marked apples, rotten 
     apples, and wormy apples.</example>
     <ul>
     <li>Exclusive/Complete Category:  Any Element of the super-category may reside in one 
     and only one of the sub-categories and all members of the super-category are members 
     of at least one of the sub-categories.</li></ul>
     <example>An automobile has in its decomposition tree an engine. For this automobile 
     any of three engines: 140 HP, 180 HP, and 220 HP. The superclass of engine is exhausted 
     by the subclasses and the subclasses are independent.</example>
     <ul>
     <li>Exclusive/ Incomplete Category:  Any Element of the super-category may reside in 
     one and only one of the sub-categories and only some members of the super-category are
     members of the sub-categories.</li></ul>
     <example>All of the automobile engines under current manufacture by GM and its 
     subsidiaries are considered as candidates for three engines that will be used in a new car.</example>

   <note>A system is composed of interacting systems. The emergent behaviors and properties of a 
   system are the result of the properties and behaviors of the sub-systems and their interactions. 
   These interactions may be highly nonlinear.
   </note>
   <note> Systems decompose hierarchically; they are systems of systems. </note>
   <example>A car has a well defined boundary with respect to its environment, and the 
   relationships are both static and dynamic. Similarly the engine has the same kinds of

  <note>Engineers involved in specification, design, manufacturing and maintenance need a 
  particular collection of information to do their work. An engineer working on the 
  cooling system of an engine needs information about a particular set of parts, behaviors 
  and properties that are particular to that engineering problem. The set of possibly 
  useful system views is very large.

   <note> The environment includes not only the external systems that couple with it for 
   useful purposes, but it also includes all external systems that may interact in a manner 
   that causes failure.    </note>
   <example>Elements in the environment need not have well defined boundaries as do systems.  
   A laptop computer can connect to a power grid. But for the design of the laptop it is 
   not important to consider the power grid as a system. It is simpler to consider it as 
   an element with an interface that the laptop connects to when needed.

 <note>Property is usefully decomposed into several categories – the measurable characteristics

 to separate behavior from structure (function from form) and to allocate behavior to structure 
 based on trade studies among alternatives.
   </note>
   <example>The acceleration of a car is in the first category. behavior.  This characteristic 
   can be observed in the normal operation of the car. The weight of the car is not directly 
   observable in the use of the car.  It requires that the car be placed on a scale to record 
   the measurable characteristic. The fact that a car has four wheels, a steering wheel on

  It encompasses the response of the system to excitation by things in its environment. In some 
  other engineering disciplines it is the analysis with differential equations that is called 
  behavior. That is not what is meant here. Here, in AP233, behavior is a model representation 
  of a functional requirement: it is what the system is to do.
   </note>
   <example>Make a fender is a behavior with several function steps, inputs of sheet steel, 
   power, paint primer, paint and the output of a fender. Ring is the behavior of a bell or

   <term id="ap233_physical property">physical property</term>
   <def>what an element exhibits or does not exhibit in response to excitation and 
   stimulation from auxiliary measurement entities that are not part of its context 
   <note>This is the subclass of property that encompasses measurable characteristics that 
   require additional instrumentation to measure them. They cannot be established from responses 
   to the environment alone. All of the "properties" used in analysis with differential 
   equations fall into this category.
   </note>
   <example>Responses of an element like mass, power consumption, mean time between failure, 
   etc. are critically important and appear in requirements. They are not measured by responses 
   to excitation from their environment.

   <term id="ap233_structure">structure</term>
   <def>the decomposition, interconnection and other static relationship among the parts of the system
   <note>Physical properties are budgeted to structure using analysis methods, and the emergent 
   performance is calculated using the same methods. Behavior is allocated to the structure. Form 
   and function are separated conceptually so that the design can be optimized by considering 
   several different structures that can provide the desired emergent behavior and properties.
   </note>
   <example>In a real example of optimization the engineer examines not just the maximum or minimum, 
   but looks at the trend in data in that region to be sure the solution is robust. That is, the 
   design solution must not degrade rapidly with small variances in the variables of design.

  <note>Parts have physical properties assigned to them. Many engineering domains think of these as 
  components, but manufacturing thinks of them as assemblies because they build assemblies.  <i>Assembly 
  is a standard ISO naming convention. It may be desirable to alias this name.</i> </note>

   <term id="ap233_link">link</term>
   <def>a particular kind of part that is used when it is helpful not to model or specify its details
   <note>Link must be provided in the concept model because a number of application tools use the 
   concept. Links ultimately are fully specified and become a system-assembly.
   </note>
   <example>In a pumping system it may be useful to define the pumps and tanks while representing the 
   piping as links without detail. At some point in the design detail like diameter, flow impedance, 
   pressure rating, and corrosion resistance must be defined. At his point the link becomes a part.

   <term id="ap233_port">port</term>
   <def>a connection point on a part in the part decomposition hierarchy
   <note>Systems interconnect with one another port-to-port. Ports couple to desired things 
   in the environment and also to the ports of things that cause failure, threaten security 
   or safety. The alias for port is interface connection, this is the term that is used in AP239. </note>
   <note>When a system interacts with its environment, the boundary between the system and 
   the environment is the collection of all interacting ports.
   </note>
   <example>Consider a ultrasonic transmitting transducer coupled to a water tank and a receiver 
   transducer coupled to the tank. The transmitter port connects to a water port and couples 
   sound energy into the water. The intensity at any point is a result of the impedance match 
   between the two ports, the radiation pattern of the transducer, and the attenuation and 
   dispersion in the water. The receiving transducer is attached to another port of the water. 
   The received signal is dependant on the relative impedance of the two ports, the sound 
   distribution in the water, and the radiation pattern of the receiving transducer. This example 
   is often oversimplified as "broadcast" neglecting the port to port conditions and the properties 
   of the medium and neglecting the ports. 
   </example>

<definition>
   <term id="ap233_interconnection">interconnection</term>
   <def>a listing of the ports that interconnect with one another
   <note>The interconnection may exist for structural reasons without any flow from port to port. 
   The interconnection may exist because functions are assigned to particular assemblies, and the 
   output from one function is an input to the other function. In this case the ports and their 
   interconnection must exist to support flow. The alias for interconnection is interface 
   connection, the term used in AP239.

<definition>
   <term id="ap233_interface specification">interface specification</term>
   <def> a description of a port of a part that includes the geometric description, input/output 
   description, protocols that must be met, assemblies of parts required to join two ports, 
   allowable defect characteristics, etc. including the emergent properties of the interface 
   that are the result of the two ports interacting, and are not associated with either
  <note>Parts interact physically through direct physical contact, exchange of elements, and 
  through forces they exert such as gravity, compression or torque. Thus input/output is bound 
  to ports and described by interfaces. The interface may consist of more than the two ports 
  and may involve an assembly of parts as in the case of two flanges that are assembled with 
  six bolts and an O-ring. The interface may also require detailed description to define what 
  occurs there or how it is maintained. 
   </note>
   <example>For two ports to connect, their interfaces must be compatible. The current carrying 
   capacity of a plug and a socket is a result of the surface area of contact, the contact 
   force, the wiping action on plugging them together, and the surface conductivity of both. 
   This is an emergent property that is not assignable to either port individually.
   </example>

<definition>
   <term id="ap233_function">function</term>
   <def>the entity in the context of modeling that transforms an input set of elements 
   into a set of output elements that may be the same or measurably different from the input set
   <note>It is a part of behavior. This is what functions do in mathematics where the 
   input/output are variables. In software the input/output is data. In systems engineering 
   the input/output are elements, matter, energy, and information. An internal function is a 
   kind of function that is allocated to and implemented by the system/structure. An external 
   function is a kind of function that is allocated to and implemented by elements in the environment. 
   </note>
   <example>The function may be "burn gasses" with an input of two moles of hydrogen and one 
   mole of oxygen. The output will be one mole of water, distinctly different from the inputs 
   and a lot of energy. This function may be followed by a function "cool to 90 degrees 
   centigrade". The input had pressure and volume proportional to temperature; the output 
   is now liquid with a well-defined volume, an isotropic compressibility and a viscosity. If 
   the next function is "cool to –10 degrees centigrade", then the viscosity goes away and the 
   compressibility becomes a fourth rank tensor relating stress to strain.

   <def>a time interval assigned to a function that defines the duration of activity of the

   <term id="ap233_function exit">function exit</term>
   <def>a function based behavior construct that links a functional decomposition to the exit
   paths identified for the parent function

  to the two exit paths in the higher-level function. When one of the exit constructs is 
  encountered, execution of the decomposition is complete and control is passed to the 
  corresponding exit path at the higher level.</example>
    </def>
</definition>

<definition>
   <term id="ap233_input output">input output</term>
   <def>elements consumed by a function are inputs and those generated by a function are outputs
 <note>The name input/output or I/O is used because a given I/O entity is generated by one 
 function and consumed by another. It is a part of behavior. In the general case outputs are 
 different things than inputs, and physical properties, behaviors, values, variances and 
 probability distributions can all change. In this general definition "function" is an element 
 of type information and cannot be realized in the physical world except through elements of 
 type matter or energy that exhibit that function. In the physical world things transform other 
 things. It is this fact of reality that results in the allocation of function to structure 
 which is really a statement that this particular structure entity exhibits this particular 
 function and it will be used to provide that transformation. The thought pattern is to think 
 of the desired transformation, function, to consider alternative things that might be used to 
 provide it, and to select among these, using a trade study based on optimization.</note>
   <example>I/O may trigger functions and it may terminate functions.</example>

<definition>
   <term id="ap233_function ordering">function ordering</term>
   <def>imposes how/when functions execute, which may be sequential, concurrent, traversed 
   iteratively, or lie on separate alternative path
  <note>David <b>some word-smithing has been done, please check</b> </note>
   <note>It is a part of behavior. There are several ways to represent function ordering. It 
   may be done with ordering operators and triggering input/output as in classical behavior 
   diagrams or it may be done with events, states, and transitions as done in state machines 
   and state charts. For this fine level of detail it is necessary to inter-compare the 
   detailed models in SEDRES with those in the concept model and those emerging from UML 2.0 development.
   </note>
   <example>A function is activated when all preceding threads of functions are complete. 
   At this point the function examines its inputs. If all triggering inputs are present the 
   function proceeds to do its work. If one or more triggering inputs is absent, the function 
   waits for them before doing its work. Triggers that arrive while the functions are running 
   are stored in a first in first out queue. Ordinary input/output that arrives while a function 
   is deactivated is stored in a last in first out queue. If the function is running it is 
   discarded.  A function is deactivated when it completes its work or is deactivated by input/output.</example>

   <term id="ap233_required budgeted property value">required budgeted property value</term>
   <def>a property value allocated to a part by a requirement, or budgeted to that part by analysis
   <note>Values that shall be met are stated in requirements. The laws of science and 
   engineering interrelate the values of properties and are used to calculate the values 
   appropriate for the parts based on the required value for the whole.</note>
   <example>A requirement may state that a space probe shall weigh no more than 150 pounds. 
   In that case the masses of the subsystems must add up to no more than 150 pounds. It is best 
   practice to budget values to the subsystems for guidance of the engineers working on the subsystems.</example>

   <term id="ap233_calculated property value">calculated property value</term>
   <def>a property value of a whole calculated or estimated from the values of the parts

   <note>The laws of science and engineering interrelate the values of properties and are 
   used to calculate the values for the whole based on the designed values for the parts.</note>
   <example>As the designers do their work they arrive at design values for the parts. 
   These values will generally differ from the budgeted values because the designers have 
   detailed information unavailable before. It is necessary to calculate the properties of 
   the whole based on these design values to ensure that requirements are satisfied by the 
   proposed design. The mass of the space probe should be 150 pounds or less, based on the 
   design data.</example>

<definition>
   <term id="ap233_target budget property value">target budget property value</term>
   <def>a temporary property value used by a designer as the design work proceeds and 
   different design alternatives are considered
   <note>As a designer considers several alternatives to meet system requirements, it 
   is necessary to carry along temporary property values to accomplish the design work.</note>
   <example>A designer may have been budgeted 40 pounds for his subsystem. He may find 
   a design solution that weighs 38 pounds. In the design process he may consider 
   alternatives that turn out to weigh 36 , 38,  41, and 43 pounds. These are temporary 
   targets. When he examines other budgets he must meet for the subsystem, the designer 
   may conclude that the 38 pound alternative is the best found.</example>

   <note>These measurements are often made when actual parts first become available. They

   models used during design.</note>
   <example>A part like a turbine blade has a number of important properties critical to 
   the performance of a jet engine, These include aerodynamic efficiency, weight, moment 
   of inertia, vibration spectra, mean time between failure, and corrosion resistance. 
   Important properties are predicted during design with analysis. Measurement is made as

<p>The following series of concept maps show module USE FROM connectivity and where Extensible selct types 
are defined.  The color coding is provided in Figure

<p><b>F.2 Systems engineering concepts</b></p>
   <p>
     The top level hierarchy of modules used to enable systems engineering concepts is shown 
     in Figure <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide:figure:cm_ap233">F-2</module_ref>.  
     Below this level of abstraction modules are extensively networked together.  To see into this modules networking 
     quagmire, modules have been grouped together relative to a few high level loosely defined natural language concepts.
     The grouping simply provides a visualization aid that the Ap233 development team has found useful.

<p><b>F.20 Reusable information from PLCS</b></p>

	<p>Approximately 70% of the STEP capabilities used by Ap233 are also used by Ap239. A large repository of 
	information relevant to both Ap239 and hence Ap233 users and implementors is at 
	<a href="http://www.plcs.org/plcs/dexlib/dex_index.htm"/></p>
