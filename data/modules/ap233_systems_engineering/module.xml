 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
  <p>
    This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
    representation of the variety of general model classifications used to
    support model based systems engineering.  This includes all models used to
    characterize the physical structure and its behaviour and the full range of
    models used to support systems engineering trade studies.
  </p> 
  
  <p>
    This module <b>ISO/TS 10303-433 Application module: AP233 systems engineering </b>
    is the top level application module for AP233.  It brings
    together the system modelling capabilities and the program management 
    capabilities.  As such, the variety of modelling paradigms used to 
    represent the physical and functional system and capabilities used 
    to support associated verification, validation and trade studies as well
    as the program management activities of systems engineering.
   </p>
  
  <note>The following overview text <b>What systems engineering is</b> repeats the introductory 
  text of <b> ISO 10303-233 Application protocol: Systems engineering.</b> 
  Additional overview material and an Ap233 documentation guide to all relevant 
  ISO 10303 application modules is provided therein.</note> 
  
   <p><b>What systems engineering is</b></p>

   <p>Systems Engineering is <i>an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to derive, evolve, 
   and verify a life cycle balanced system solution that satisfies customer expectations and 
   meets public acceptability.</i> (IEEE 1220-1984) </p>

   <p><i>Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization 
   of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early 
   in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and 
   system validation while considering the complete problem.</i></p>

   <p>The complete problem spans:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>stakeholder needs;</li>
   <li>requirements;</li>
   <li>the enterprise and competitors;</li>
   <li>concept;</li>
   <li>design;</li>
   <li>design optimization by trade studies;</li>
   <li>design validation and verification;</li>
   <li>manufacture;</li>
   <li>product validation and verification;</li>
   <li>test;</li>
   <li>maintenance;</li>
   <li>operations;</li>
   <li>performance;</li>
   <li>disposal;</li>
   <li>training and support;</li>
   <li>cost and schedule;</li>
   <li>program management.</li>
   </ul>

   <p><i>Systems Engineering integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort 
   forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. 
   Systems Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with 
   the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs.</i> (Definition of the 
   International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE))</p>
   
   <p>Systems Engineering makes extensive use of specification of all interfaces, performance 
   analysis, and trade studies to ensure that the system is near optimal for and will be accepted 
   by stakeholders and the marketplace. It is applicable to anything for which a well-defined 
   boundary can be established whether mechanical, electrical, electronic, information, chemical, 
   biological, social or organizational.</p>
   
   <p><b>What AP233 is</b></p>
   
   <p>AP233 is an information model that captures the concepts used in Systems Engineering, as 
   <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:introduction:figure:se1:1">Figure 1</module_ref> shows. 
   These concepts may be represented by a variety of symbols and each set of such 
   symbols can be combined into an number of different views. A particular set of symbols and views 
   constitutes a language. Tools automate the use of such a language to represent and model systems. 
   For any language a number of different tools may exist and they may not be able to exchange data 
   even using the same language unless they have compatible schema for storing that language. Thus a 
   single set of concepts results in a plethora of languages and tools.</p>

		<figure id="se1" number="1"> 
		<title>AP233 Information model</title>
			<img src="Slide9.gif"/>	
		</figure>

		
    <p>The tools are used by engineers. Frequently it is the organization that establishes the process, 
    a specification of the views and development order that must be followed, that the engineers 
    shall follow. Two organizations using the same tool may or may not use equivalent views in doing 
    their work.</p>

    <p>In general, there is no single tool that can support all the work that must be done so the 
    tools are most efficient when put in an environment that enables them to exchange the information 
    artifacts that the engineers produce using the tools. Often, different tools incorporated in a 
    single environment cannot exchange information. Very often, the organizations in a supply chain 
    or working together on a single project as a consortium will have different environments 
    incorporating different sets of tools. Yet all members of the supply chain or consortium need 
    to efficiently share data rigorously and at low cost.</p>

    <p>The application protocol, like AP233 for Systems Engineering, provides a solution to this 
    problem. Each tool needs an interface that interconnects the tool with the AP. The interface 
    transforms the data artifacts from the tool for correct storage in the AP and transforms data 
    supplied by the AP for use by the tool.</p>

    <p>In this way AP233 supports information exchange among organizations, even though their 
    environments contain different tools.  AP233 is the glue for organizations working together 
    in a consortium or a supply chain.</p>
    
   <p><b>What Ap233 contains</b></p>
   
   <p><module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:introduction:figure:se2:2">Figure 2</module_ref> shows. 
   shows the basic capabilities of AP233. It is divided into two main parts, Program 
   Management and System Requirements/Design. Major capabilities are listed in each box. The 
   relevant kinds of tools that are applicable surround each box. The two main parts of the work 
   are interconnected by risk analysis, issue resolution, and management authorization and review. 
   Where these capabilities share concepts, i.e. where they are semantically equivalent, there can 
   be exchange of information artifacts among any of the tools through the tool interfaces and the 
   AP233 information model.</p>


		<figure id="se2" number="2"> 
		<title>AP233 content and associated tools</title>
		<img src="Slide10.gif"/>	
		</figure>

   <p>The same transfer is possible where there is semantic identity with downstream design, 
   manufacture, test, and maintenance tools. There are many ISO 10303 Application Protocols 
   (APs) for a variety of industrial businesses such as, geometry, circuit board and chip 
   development, shipbuilding, building construction, furniture design and manufacture, maintenance.
   A large number of different tools are used by these businesses and interface through their 
   own APs. All of these APs have been made modular and share, as much as possible, the same modules 
   This approach is vital for connecting systems engineering tools to downstream tools and it makes 
   possible the use of AP233 as an integrating AP across all the others.</p>

   <p>The shared modularity has also required that the AP233 modules use naming conventions that 
   were developed a decade or more ago by developers in other disciplines. The consequence is that 
   AP233 contains names in the detailed EXPRESS code that will seem foreign to practicing systems 
   engineers. It also means that many modules will use a different common module for widely needed 
   representation of concepts like number or a weighting factor. Thus the reader who looks at a 
   particular module may not see there an entity that he knows belongs there because it resides 
   in a shared module and is connected to the module he is reading. Efficient use of the EXPRESS 
   language also means that the connection to the common module may go through a chain of classes 
   and subclasses; it may be very indirect for the reader. </p>

   <p>For the reasons above, this introduction does not attempt to show the reader the details of 
   the EXPRESS code. Rather this introduction attempts to: </p>
	<ol>
	<li>describe AP233 as a container of concepts shared by tools; </li>
	<li>list number of the AP233 capabilities; </li>
	<li>show kinds of tools that can interface with one another through AP233;</li>
	<li>show the major mappings of capabilities onto the modules that constitute the information module.</li>
	</ol>

   <p>Those who wish to investigate the modules in detail can use this Introduction as a guide to 
   that adventure. 
   <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:introduction:figure:se3:3">Figure 3</module_ref> shows. 
   shows a top-level view of the module hierarchy. It is important to be 
   aware that the boxes under a higher box do not necessarily completely compose it. Rather there 
   may be additional things in the box above. This is not intuitive to those accustomed to hardware 
   development, but it is a result of the software languages.</p>

   <p>The capabilities of <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:introduction:figure:se2:2">Figure 2</module_ref>
   map into modules of <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:introduction:figure:se3:3">Figure 3</module_ref> 
   as identified below. Be 
   aware that these are not leaf cell modules. There may be structure below them, and they may 
   connect to modules above and below through type extensions. This makes reading the code or 
   the graphic EXPRESS-G diagrams difficult, but it is the nature of the language. </p>

These attempt to bridge the gap between what the system engineer wants to see for review purposes and how the 
information modelling experts enabled AP233.</p>

<p><b>F.1 Concept maps</b></p>

<p>The following series of concept maps show module USE FROM connectivity and where Extensible select types 
are defined.  The color coding is provided in Figure 
<module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide:figure:cm_code">F.1</module_ref>. </p>

<p><b>F.2 Systems engineering concepts</b></p>
   <p>
     The top level hierarchy of modules used to enable systems engineering concepts is shown 
     in Figure <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide:figure:cm_ap233">F.2</module_ref>.  
     Below this level of abstraction modules are extensively networked together.  To see into this modules networking 
     quagmire, modules have been grouped together relative to a few high level loosely defined natural language concepts.
     The grouping simply provides a visualization aid that the AP233 development team has found useful.

<p><b>F.19 Why concepts</b></p>
   <p>
     The modules and extensible select information items that are networked together to  
     model why concepts in AP233 are shown in Figure 
     <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide:figure:cm_why">F.19</module_ref>. 
   </p>
		      <figure id="cm_why" number="F.19">
			<title>Why concepts</title>
			<img src="cm_why.png"/>
		      </figure>
	 <p>Capabilites that enable why concepts are realized by:</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="document_and_version_identification:1_scope"/>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="document_assignment:1_scope"/>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="document_definition:1_scope"/>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="document_management:1_scope"/>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="document_structure:1_scope"/>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="external_item_identification_assignment:1_scope"/>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="file_identification:1_scope"/>.</li>
	 </ul>

	 <p>Additionally these modules USE FROM several foundational modules that enable common ISO 10303 project concepts:</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="Document_properties:1_scope"/> - continued in the Representation concepts figure
	 <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide:figure:cm_rep">F.10</module_ref>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="Management_resource_information:1_scope"/> - continued in the Management resource information figure
	 <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide:figure:cm_mri">F.8</module_ref>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="Product_version:1_scope"/> - continued in the What concepts figure
	 <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide:figure:cm_wht">F.15</module_ref>;</li>
	 <li>items within the scope of application module <module_ref linkend="Product_view_definition:1_scope"/> - continued in the What concepts figure
	 <module_ref linkend="ap233_systems_engineering:f_usage_guide:figure:cm_wht">F.15</module_ref>.</li>
	 </ul>

	 <p>Extensible select types provide the cross coupling of concepts needed to realize the whole: </p>
	 <ul>
	 <li><module_ref linkend="document_assignment:4_types">documented_element_select</module_ref> a product data item to which a document can be assigned that provides information about that product data;</li>
	 <li><module_ref linkend="external_item_identification_assignment:4_types">external_identification_item</module_ref> an external product or activity data item whose source can be identified.</li>
	 </ul>
	
	 
<p><b>F.20 Extensible type select lists</b></p>

	<p>The problem of creating extensible type lists has proven to be an extreme challenge.
	To explain what has been done a publish and subscribe analogy is used.</p>  
	<p>Schemas enable foundational capability that may be at the atomic or macro-molecular level.
	Schemas enable capabilities via entities that other capabilities can access by "subscription".
	The extensible type is the subscription list name. The list itself
	identifies all subscribers (entities).</p>  
	<p>The problem in STEP is that these lists are defined within schemas that have a domain  
	bounded by the capabilities of all schemas in its USE FROM list
	and those lists that it inherits.  On the bottom line, this creates a list creation problem 
	that is 3 dimensional. The dimensions are: bounded domain, entities and extensible types.  To 
	size this, AP233 has about 10 major bounded domains, 1000 entities and 100 extensible types.  
	If one does not apply any organizational logic to the problem this implies a need for 
	1,000,000 yes/no cognitive decisions to fully resolve the AP233 type extend problem.</p>
	
	<p>In order to penetrate this problem some logical approach to scalability and 
	checkability was required.  This has lead to the concept based groupings shown in these Annex F 
	concept maps.  These groupings enable the type extend problem to be broken
	down into scalable and checkable pieces that can be easily aggregated
	to create the desired whole.</p>	
	
	
<p><b>F.21 Harmonizing Extensible type select lists with others</b></p>

	<p>Entries into the type extend lists stem from two primary needs; namely, 
	 harmonization with STEP APs relevant to AP233 and satisfaction of AP233 needs.  
	 The first group of extends needed for harmonization are derived from the extend lists 
	 used within the following STEP modules - <b>not used by AP233</b>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>1272 - activity_characterized;</li>
		<li>1280 - required_resource_characterized;</li>
		<li>1281 - resource_item_characterized;</li>
		<li>1282 - resource_management_characterized;</li>
		<li>1283 - resource_as_realized_characterized;</li>
		<li>1285 - work_request_characterized;</li>
		<li>1286 - work_order_characterized;</li>
		<li>1289 - ap239_management_resource_information;</li>
		<li>1292 - ap239_product_definition_information;</li>
		<li>1293 - ap239_part_definition_information;</li>
		<li>1295 - ap239_properties;</li>
		<li>1296 - condition_evaluation_characterized;</li>
		<li>1298 - activity_method_characterized;</li>
		<li>1301 - work_output_characterized;</li>
		<li>1306 - ap239_task_specification_resourced;</li>
		<li>1307 - ap239_work_definition;</li>
		<li>1628 - design_product_data_management.</li>
	</ul>
