	<!-- Introduction -->
	<purpose>
		<p>
		This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of the data that 
		identify and characterize products offered to market and of their components. This application 
		module provides specifications suitable for the representation of any kind of such products.
		In particular, this application module enables the representation of products proposed to market 
		with a great number of variants and whose composition is characterized due to the selection 
		among a set of different product features. 
		</p>
		<example>
		Examples of such products are the products developed by the furniture industry, the automotive 
		industry and the commercial airplane industry.
		</example>
		<p>
		This application module specifies the data types and their constraints. It specifies the conformance 
		class 1 of ISO 10303-236.
		</p>
		<p>
		A catalogue contains a list of references of different commercial products that are proposed to 
		customers or to distributors. A catalogue provides a commercial view of the products of a supplier 
		or manufacturer but it does not represent the design information of the commercial products.
		</p>
		<p>
		It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.
		</p>
		<p>
		It provides also specifications suitable for the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, 
		geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of product components as well as their 
		spacial location in order to represent a decoration project.     
		</p>
		<p>
		The core of the product model is catalogue information. This information is connected to other parts in 
		order to define the geometry of the products and to select a set of product features.
		</p>
		<p> 
		This application module provides the definition for the main information data of a catalogue,such as the 
		definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a product that 
		the customer can chose in order to select one product from another). The structure of the product 
		(the product itself or the decomposition of the product in its components), the effectivity of the catalogue 
		itself or its products, the effectivity of the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) 
		that gives additional information about the product such as detailed information, pictures, technical 
		drawings, and a classification of the products in order they could be found easily in a catalogue 
		depending on different search criteria; the properties of the product (not selectable by the user). 
		It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalogue specification in the 
		<module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO 1303-1103</module_ref> (Product class).
		</p>
		<p>
		It also adds to the catalog data information the capability of including the geometry of the products. 
		It includes application modules for the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, 
		geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of product components, through subtypes 
		of the generic type 
		<express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">
		Geometric Model</express_ref>.
		</p>
		<p>
		In particular, this application module enables the representation of products proposed to market with a 
		great number of variants and whose composition is characterized with expressions of operands selected 
		in a set of product features.
		</p>
		<note>
		This application module is an extension of the Catalog_data_information module.
		</note>
		<p>
		This application module specifies the schema associated with conformance class 2 of application protocol 
		ISO 10303-236.
