 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation and classification of documents and document information that may apply to product data, activity data, document information, or other documents.  This module combines the functionality of the following modules to provide the capability to classify and represent documents, document information, and management information:  </p>
<ul>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1290);</li>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="ap239_management_resource_information:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1289);</li>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="message:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1270) </li>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="envelope:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1265) </li>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="information_rights:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1241) </li>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1255) </li>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1256) </li>
</ul>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> module enables the representation of:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>
information that identifies documents (<express_ref linkend="document_and_version_identification:arm:Document_and_version_identification_arm.Document"/>) and versions of documents (<express_ref linkend="document_and_version_identification:arm:Document_and_version_identification_arm.Document_version"/>); 
   </li>

   <li>
     <p>
       facility to assign documents (<express_ref linkend="document_assignment:arm:Document_assignment_arm.Document_assignment"/>) to product or activity data, or to assign sections of documents to product or activity data (<express_ref linkend="document_assignment:arm:Document_assignment_arm.Partial_document_assignment"/>);
   </p>
   <note number="1">
     The definition of the product or activity data to which the document or document section is assigned is provided by extending the select, <express_ref linkend="document_assignment:arm:Document_assignment_arm.documented_element_select"/>, in a further module.
   </note>
   </li>

   <li>
     definitions of document versions in a digital (<express_ref linkend="document_definition:arm:Document_definition_arm.Digital_document_definition"/>) or physical format (<express_ref linkend="document_definition:arm:Document_definition_arm.Physical_document_definition"/>); 
   </li>

   <li>digital files (<express_ref linkend="file_identification:arm:File_identification_arm.Digital_file"/>) stored on an electronic storage device or non-digital hardcopies (<express_ref linkend="file_identification:arm:File_identification_arm.Hardcopy"/>);</li>

   <li>relationships between files (<express_ref linkend="document_structure:arm:Document_structure_arm.File_relationship"/>) or document definitions (<express_ref linkend="document_structure:arm:Document_structure_arm.Document_definition_relationship"/>);</li>

   <li>assignment of properties to a particular representation of a document version or a file (<express_ref linkend="document_properties:arm:Document_properties_arm.Assigned_document_property"/>);</li>
   </ul>
  <p>
The <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> module addresses the requirements to define a document.  A document is defined as a body of information that can be packaged for delivery on a single medium.  Some examples of documents are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>drawings; </li>
    <li>reports; </li>
    <li>standards; </li>
    <li>databases; </li>
    <li>application software; </li>
    <li>engineering drawings; </li>
    <li>CAD models; </li>
    <li>computer file reports; </li>
    <li>video clips; </li>
    <li>tapes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A document may be represented by a set of digital files that collectively represents a complete digital document.  
  </p>
  <p>Electronic document representations are sets of digital files that collectively represent the entire document.  
  </p>
  <example number="1">A set of raster files, a set of IGES files, or a combination set of raster and IGES files that represent a complete document. 
  </example>
<p>Non-electronic document representations are sets of pages, sheets, cards, or other medium, together with the message recorded on the medium that collectively represents the entire document.  A document may have more than one document representation; some of these may be electronic while others are not.  All document representations of a single iteration of a particular document must have the same information content; formats (both electronic and visual) may vary, but the content must be the same.  Different formats are different representations of the document.
  </p>
  <example number="2">Paper plots of technical drawings, Mylar traces, microfiche, or floppy disks are examples of non-digital files. 
  </example>
<p>Document management provides a capability to attach, link or reference documents, with a limited set of metadata to allow searching on author, date, version title, type, encoding method, etc.  It also provides a capability to classify documents.
</p>
<p>Document management also provides a capability to hold definitions of "documents" which can be generated directly from data held in any format.  This provides ability to assemble documents from file, including pictures, images, videos and the results of queries on data held in any format.  Document management enables holding information contained within intelligent documents.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
      <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="ap239_management_resource_information:introduction"/> module enables the representation and classification of management information that may apply to document, product, or activity data.  This module combines the functionality of the following modules to extend the capability to classify documents and document information, and to provide the capability to classify and represent management information.  </p>
<ul>
     <li><module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1288);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1246);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1114);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="external_class:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1275);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="identification_assignment:introduction"/> (ISO/TS 10303-1021);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="set_theory:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1210);</li>

</ul>
   <p>
The <module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/> module provides the ability for other modules to assign management information to product and activity data.  Such management information comprises:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>dates and times;</li>
     <li>people and organizations;</li>
     <li>approvals;</li>
     <li>identifiers for items;</li>
     <li>certificates and contracts;</li>
     <li>language identification;</li>
     <li>projects;</li>
     <li>security classifications.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     In some cases this information is applied to the management data.  For example, to specify who specified the security classification for some product data and when, requires the assignment of person and organization, and date and time to the security classification assignment. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> module provides for a classification of an attribute on an EXPRESS entity.  The standard values used by the classification are defined as <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"> Classes </express_ref>.
   </p>
   <note number="2">
     The definition of the <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"/> may be stored in an external class library.
   </note>
   <note number="3">
     When the attribute of an EXPRESS entity is classified, the value of the attribute on an instance of the EXPRESS entity will be the <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class.name">name</express_ref> or  <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class.id">identifier</express_ref> of the class.
   </note>
<p>
</p>
     <p>
The <module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> module provides for the assignment of classification information to document, product, or activity data.  This provides a generic capability that may be specialized and further constrained in other application modules.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <express_ref linkend="external_class:arm:External_class_arm.External_class"/>  module specifies the representation of <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class">Classes</express_ref> that are defined external to a data exchange file in an External Class Library.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <module_ref linkend="identification_assignment:introduction"/> module provides for the representation of assignments of an identifier to product or activity data.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> The <module_ref linkend="set_theory:introduction"/> module enables set theory relationships between classes.  This includes the following relationships:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>complement;</li>
     <li>intersection;</li>
     <li>power set;</li>
     <li>proper subset;</li>
     <li>same membership (that is equality);</li>
     <li>subset;</li>
     <li>union.</li>
   </ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="message:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of message.  A message is a collection of information made at a particular time for some particular purpose.  The message module contains the meta-data that describes the message.  The structure and format of the content is out of scope, but is intended to range from a structured report corresponding to, say, a maintenance form, to an arbitrary collection of database abstracts, documents and other media as might correspond to a dossier on some unexpected problem with a product. Also out of scope is the sending of the message, which is covered by the Envelope module.
</p>
<p>An essential part of the message is its purpose. Message records this in two ways.  Firstly, it may record the intentions of the sender, for example, "The attached gives evidence of severe cracking around the engine mountings. Request urgent grounding and inspection of the fleet".  Secondly, the message will be part of some business process, and may, in many cases, be automatically processed.  For example, a field input made on some automatic data recorder may simply be input into a database without further ado.  Further, a state may be associated to the message, which will enable tracking of the message through the process.  This can be applied by both sender and recipient.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
The <module_ref linkend="envelope:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of envelope.  An envelope is a wrapper for a message.  It is provided in order to maintain an audit trail of transmission.  
</p>
<p>
Previously, audit trail information has been held externally to the STEP environment.  However increase volumes and frequency of transaction, particularly of small extracts from a database, require the association of transmission information with the database.  For example, in an automated support environment, failure to notify significant defects, maintenance actions or procedural changes may be legally significant.  Just as with a physical letter where the envelope is quite distinct from the content, in this module, the envelope is quite distinct from the message it contains.  However, the analogy should not be pushed too far.  For example, in the envelope module, provision is made to use the envelope to send back receipts.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="information_rights:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of rights concerning the access and use of information. That is, it records the right of a person or organization to use information in a certain way, or for a certain purpose. These rights include ownership of copyright, ownership of intellectual property or a grant to use information, perhaps restricted to a particular contract. Rights over personal data are not considered.
   </p>
   <p>
The recording of usage rights is important in collaborative work, particularly where a shared data environment is used. Such an environment may contain data from several competing companies, none of whom may see the other's data, although all such data may be visible to a coordinating contractor.

   </p>
   <p>
The module allows the recording of a particular right, the historical act of granting that right to an organization, perhaps under a particular contract, and the assignment of that right to particular data items.  The granting of the right can be approved in general, or only for specific items of data. The latter would be used where special permission is needed for a particular data item.  Under this module, rights cannot be granted to a general class of item, and this would need an extension to the current module.  The module supports both the recording of the currently available rights and the history of granting rights.
   </p>
   <p>
Rights are always defined within a legal framework. It is incumbent on users of this model to ensure that the legal framework is in place under which the rights are interpreted, and to ensure that the use and interpretation of rights are well defined.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p> 
The <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of a type of state.
</p>
<p>
The state definition module identifies a type of state by specifying the criteria that shall be satisfied for something to be in a state of that type. 
</p>
<example number="3">A state definition that is defined by the presence of an identified type of fault in a type of product. </example> 
<p>
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of state observed.
</p>
<p>
The state observed module identifies an observed state, which may be either predicted or actual, and enabling it to be linked to the thing or things that are in the state.  An observed state represents a period of time when the criteria defining the state type either are or will be satisfied for one or more items.  Actual observed states therefore correspond to a period in the life of something.  States are not limited to products but may apply to activities, people, and organizations.
