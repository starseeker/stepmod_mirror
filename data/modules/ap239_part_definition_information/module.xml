<p>Ap239_part_definition_information describes the product's performance, functional, and physical attributes.  This includes requirements information, for example, specifications, requirements documents; and design information, for example, drawings, part models, software listings and design descriptions.  It provides the technical basis for actions taken during all product life cycle phases and for product validation.  Part definition information defines the product requirements, documents the product attributes and is the authoritative source for configuration definition and control.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The contents of ap239_part_definition_information may, in certain contexts, be known by different names (aliases).  Some of these are:

<li>products that may come into existence as a consequence of some realization process. This includes parts and documents;</li>
<li>products that are functions.</li>
</ul>
</note>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="product_version:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of the data that designate a version of a product.
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="product_view_definition:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of characterization views of a product version.

</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="identification_assignment:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of assignments of an identifier to product or activity data.
</p>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="ap239_document_management:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation and classification of documents and document data that may apply to product data, activity data, document data, or other documents.  This module combines the functionality of the following modules to provide the capability to classify and represent documents, document data, and management data.  
</p>
<ul>
     <li> <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1290);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="ap239_management_resource_information:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1289);</li>
</ul>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="document_management:introduction"/> module enables the representation of:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>data that identify documents (<express_ref linkend="document_and_version_identification:arm:Document_and_version_identification_arm.Document"/>) and versions of documents (<express_ref linkend="document_and_version_identification:arm:Document_and_version_identification_arm.Document_version"/>); </li>

   <li>
     <p>
       facility to assign documents (<express_ref linkend="document_assignment:arm:Document_assignment_arm.Document_assignment"/>) to product or activity data, or to assign sections of documents to product or activity data (<express_ref linkend="document_assignment:arm:Document_assignment_arm.Partial_document_assignment"/>);
   </p>
   <note number="1">
     The definition of the product or activity data to which the document or document section is assigned is provided by extending the select, <express_ref linkend="document_assignment:arm:Document_assignment_arm.documented_element_select"/>, in a further module.
   </note>
   </li>

   <li>definitions of document versions in a digital (<express_ref linkend="document_definition:arm:Document_definition_arm.Document_definition"/>) or physical format (<express_ref linkend="document_definition:arm:Document_definition_arm.Physical_document_definition"/>); 
   </li>

   <li>digital files (<express_ref linkend="file_identification:arm:File_identification_arm.Digital_file"/>) stored on an electronic storage device or non-digital hardcopies (<express_ref linkend="file_identification:arm:File_identification_arm.Hardcopy"/>);</li>

   <li>relationships between files (<express_ref linkend="document_structure:arm:Document_structure_arm.File_relationship"/>) or document definitions (<express_ref linkend="document_structure:arm:Document_structure_arm.Document_definition_relationship"/>);</li>

   <li>assignment of properties to a particular representation of a document version or a file (<express_ref linkend="document_properties:arm:Document_properties_arm.Assigned_document_property"/>);</li>
   </ul>
  <p>
    The Document module addresses the requirements to define a document.  A document is defined as a body of information or data that can be packaged for delivery on a single medium. Some examples of documents are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>drawings; </li>
    <li>reports; </li>
    <li>standards; </li>
    <li>databases; </li>
    <li>application software; </li>
    <li>engineering drawings; </li>
    <li>CAD models; </li>
    <li>computer file reports; </li>
    <li>video clips; </li>
    <li>tapes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
A document may be represented by a set of digital files that collectively represents a complete digital document.  
  </p>
  <p>
Electronic document representations are sets of digital files that collectively represent the entire document.  
  </p>
  <example number="1">A set of raster files, a set of IGES files, or a combination set of raster and IGES files that represent a complete document. 
  </example>
  <p>
Non-electronic document representations are sets of pages, sheets, cards, or other medium, together with the message recorded on the medium that collectively represents the entire document.  A document may have more than one document representation; some of these may be electronic while others are not.  All document representations of a single iteration of a particular document must have the same information content; formats (both electronic and visual) may vary, but the content must be the same.  Different formats are different representations of the document.
  </p>
  <example number="2">Paper plots of technical drawings, Mylar traces, microfiche, or floppy disks are examples of non-digital files. 
  </example>
  <p>
Document management provides a capability to attach, link or reference documents, with a limited set of metadata to allow searching on author, date, version title, type, encoding method, etc.  It also provides a capability to classify documents.
  </p>
  <p>
Document management also provides a capability to hold definitions of "documents" which can be generated directly from data held in any format.  This provides ability to assemble documents from file, including pictures, images, videos and the results of queries on data held in any format.  Document management enables holding information contained within intelligent documents.
  </p>
   <p>
The <module_ref linkend="ap239_management_resource_information:introduction"/> module enables the representation and classification of management data that may apply to document, product, or activity data.  This module combines the functionality of the following modules to extend the capability to classify documents and document data, and to provide the capability to classify and represent management data.  
</p>
<ul>
     <li><module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1288);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1246);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1114);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="external_class:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1275);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="identification_assignment:introduction"/> (ISO/TS 10303-1021);</li>
     <li><module_ref linkend="set_theory:introduction"/> (ISO/CD-TS 10303-1210);</li>
</ul>
   <p>
The <module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/> module provides the ability for other modules to assign management information to product and activity data.  Such management data comprises:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>dates and times;</li>
     <li>people and organizations;</li>
     <li>approvals;</li>
     <li>identifiers for items;</li>
     <li>certificates and contracts;</li>
     <li>language identification;</li>
     <li>projects;</li>
     <li>security classifications.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     In some cases these data are also applied to the management data.  For example, to specify who specified the security classification for some product data and when, requires the assignment of person and organization, and date and time to the security classification assignment. 
</p>
   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="attribute_classification:introduction"/> module provides for a classification of an attribute on an EXPRESS entity.  The standard values used by the classification are defined as <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"> Classes </express_ref>.
   </p>
   <note number="2">
     The definition of the <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"/> may be stored in an external class library.
   </note>
   <note number="3">
     When the attribute of an EXPRESS entity is classified, the value of the attribute on an instance of the EXPRESS entity will be the <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class.name">name</express_ref> or  <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class.id">identifier</express_ref> of the class.
   </note>
     <p>
The <module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> module provides for the assignment of classification information to document, product, or activity data.  This provides a generic capability that may be specialized and further constrained in other application modules.
</p>
<p>
The <express_ref linkend="external_class:arm:External_class_arm.External_class"/>  module specifies the representation of <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class">Classes</express_ref> that are defined external to a data exchange file in an External Class Library.
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="identification_assignment:introduction"/> module provides for the representation of assignments of an identifier to product or activity data.
</p>
<p> 
The <module_ref linkend="set_theory:introduction"/> module enables set theory relationships between document classes.  This includes the following relationships:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>complement;</li>
     <li>intersection;</li>
     <li>power set;</li>
     <li>proper subset;</li>
     <li>same membership (that is equality);</li>
     <li>subset;</li>
     <li>union.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="ap239_properties:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of properties of objects, their values and types, and classifications, in order to enable product life cycle support.
</p>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="product_as_individual:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of data that records the identification of an existing or potential future artifact - an actual product whose properties can only be known by observation or by derivation from observations.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is likely, but not essential, that the artifact, was or will be made from a version of a product design, which will be represented by the <module_ref linkend="product_identification:introduction">product_identification</module_ref>, <module_ref linkend="product_version:introduction"> product_version</module_ref> and <module_ref linkend="product_view_definition:introduction">product_view_definition</module_ref> modules.
   </p>
   <p>
     An actual product that has been made is represented by a <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/> entity.
   </p>
   <p>
     A product that is planned to be made is represented a <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_planned"/> entity.
   </p>

   <example number="1">
     The front wheel on your car is an actual product - 
     <express_ref 
       linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/>.
   </example>
   <example number="2">
     The computer with the serial number "PN X0467-71281" is an actual product -
     <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/>.
   </example>
   <example number="3">
     The plane, with tail number "GXY 8910", ordered by "Air 3000" that is just about to be manufactured is a predicted product -
     <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_planned"/>.       
   </example>

<p>
The <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction"/> module specifies an application module that supports the requirement to manage interfaces between products (see <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction:figure:f1">FIGURE 1</module_ref>).  An interface is the interaction between co-functioning products, or a product and its environment, and, in order to ensure repeatability, is the subject of an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/>.  The specification defines the product attributes that are necessary to exist at a common boundary.
</p>
		<example number="1">
       Some product attributes:
<ul>
<li>fuel flow rate; </li>
	<li>required speed;</li>
	<li>operating temperature;</li>
	<li>physical shape; </li>
	<li>dimensional tolerance. </li>
</ul>
</example>
<p>
     In some industry sectors, an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/> is referred to as an Interface Control Document or Drawing. 
   </p>
<p>
An <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/> is a <express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> and, thus, may have an identification, versions, and view definitions.  
</p>
<p>
     The interaction of two interfaced products is represented by an <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connection"/>.  Many types of interaction are possible. 
</p>
		<example number="2">

Some interactions: 
     <ul>
	<li>physical interaction, such as two mechanical gears meshing; </li>
	<li>optical interaction, such as an infrared connection between a remote control and a television; </li>
	<li>electrical interaction, such as the current at 240 volts, 50 hertz from a domestic supply as required by a refrigerator.  </li>
     </ul>
	</example>
<p>
     The interaction, as defined by the <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_specification"/>, is through at least one <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connector"/>. 
   </p>
<p>
An <express_ref linkend="interface:arm:Interface_arm.Interface_connector"/> is a <express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> and, thus, may have the attributes that are necessary to ensure the viability of the interface.
   </p>
		<figure id="f1">
			<title>A typical interface</title>
			<img src="interface_picture_typical.gif"/>
		</figure>

   <p>
     The <module_ref linkend="interface_lifecycle:introduction"/> module specifies an application module for the representation of the life cycle phase of existing interfaces between actual products (as realized), and includes planned interfaces between planned products. 
     See module <module_ref linkend="interface:introduction"> ISO-10303-1251 - Interface </module_ref> for additional information. 
   </p>

   <p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_assignment:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of relationships between requirements and items to which they are assigned, and between requirements and the items which are their source.
   </p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_identification_and_version:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of the data that identify a requirement and versions of requirements.
</p>
	<note number="1">
		 The concept of a "requirement", in this context, is very general in character; but this part of ISO 10303 is chiefly directed at the exchange and sharing of data between requirements engineering applications such as those used in the systems engineering and related industrial domains.
		</note>
	<note number="2">
		This module has been developed by the AP233 development team.
		</note>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_view_definition:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of characterization views of a requirement version.
   </p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="requirement_view_definition_relationship:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of relationships between requirements which are expressed as relationships between requirement view definitions, for example, the relationships are dependent on the version of the requirement and the view of that version.
   </p>
<p> 
The <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/> module specifies the representation of a type of state.
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_definition:introduction"/> module also identifies a type of state by specifying the criteria that shall be satisfied for something to be in a state of that type. 
</p>
<example>A state definition that is defined by the presence of an identified type of fault in a type of product. </example> 
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/> module the representation of state observed.
</p>
<p>
The <module_ref linkend="state_observed:introduction"/> module identifies an observed state, which may be either predicted or actual, and enables it to be linked to the thing or things that are in the state.  An observed state represents a period of time when the criteria defining the state type either are or will be satisfied for one or more items.  Actual observed states therefore correspond to a period in the life of something.  States are not limited to products but may apply to activities, people, and organizations.
