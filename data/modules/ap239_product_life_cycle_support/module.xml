 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of product life cycle support.  It provides a
     comprehensive capability to describe a set of products needing support and
     the work needed to sustain such products in an operational condition. 
   </p>
   <p>
     The module enables the creation and management through time of an
     Assured set of Product and Support Information (APSI) which can be used to
     specify and control required support activities throughout a product's
     life.  This information is assumed to be subject to configuration change
     management to sustain the information needed to support the product in line
     with the changing product, over its full life cycle. 
   </p>

   <p>
     Capability is also provided to describe the resources required,
     provided and used to deliver support, and to record the history of the
     product usage, state and work done.  This concept is illustrated by Figure

   </figure>

   <p>
     The module was developed to represent the data associated with complex
     engineering assets, such as aircraft, ships or weapon systems, which may
     exist either as design, or as a realized item.  It can also be applied to
     much simpler products such a pump or an amplifier.  The range of target
     products is shown by Figure

      Most of the capability provided by this module is contained in
      sub-ordinate modules.  The top of the AP239 module hierarchy is shown in
      Figure
