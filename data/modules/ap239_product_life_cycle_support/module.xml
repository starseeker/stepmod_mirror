 <purpose>
   <p>
    This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of product life cycle support (PLCS).  It provides a
     comprehensive capability to describe a set of products needing support and
     the work needed to sustain such products in an operational condition. 
   </p>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 enables the creation and management through time of
     a set of Assured Product and Support Information (APSI) which can be used
     to specify and control required support activities throughout a product's
     life. This information is assumed to be subject to configuration change
     management to sustain the validity of the information as changes occur
     through life.
   </p>

   <p>
     Capability is also provided to describe the resources required,
     provided and used to deliver support, and to record the history of the
     product usage, state and work done.  This concept is illustrated by Figure
     <module_ref
       linkend="ap239_product_life_cycle_support:introduction:figure:f1">
       1</module_ref>.
   </p>

   </figure>

   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 was developed to represent the data associated with
     major engineering assets, such as aircraft, ships or weapon systems,
     which may exist either as a product design, or as an actual product.  It
     can also be applied to much simpler products such a pump or an amplifier.
     The main industry focus for this part of ISO 10303 is shown by the shaded
     area of Figure
     <module_ref
       linkend="ap239_product_life_cycle_support:introduction:figure:f2">
       2</module_ref>.
     and is characterized by complex products with long life
     cycles and demanding in-service support requirements.
    </p>

      <title>Market segmentation</title>
      <img src="figure2.png"/>
    </figure>
    
    <p>
      Most of the capability provided by this module is contained in
      sub-ordinate modules.  The upper parts of the module hierarchy for this part of ISO 10303 is shown in
      Figure
     <module_ref
       linkend="ap239_product_life_cycle_support:introduction:figure:f3">
       3</module_ref>.
    </p>
    <note>
      Only the main modules are shown in Figure
      <module_ref
       linkend="ap239_product_life_cycle_support:introduction:figure:f3">
       3</module_ref>.
     The remainder have been excluded to reduce the complexity of the diagram. 
     See clause 4.1 of a module for details of any modules that it uses.

    <p>
      This part of ISO 10303 combines the functionality of the following parts of ISO 10303 into a single root:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <module_ref
          linkend="Ap239_product_status_recording:introduction"/> 
        (ISO 10303-1304);
      </li>
      <li>
        <module_ref
          linkend="Ap239_product_definition_information:introduction"/>
        (ISO 10303-1292);
      </li>
      <li>
        <module_ref linkend="Ap239_activity_recording:introduction"/>
        (ISO 10303-1287);
      </li>
      <li>
        <module_ref linkend="Ap239_work_definition:introduction"/> 
        (ISO 10303-1307);
      </li>
      <li>
        <module_ref
          linkend="Ap239_task_specification_resourced:introduction"/> 
        (ISO 10303-1306).    
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>
      <module_ref
        linkend="Ap239_product_status_recording:introduction"/> 
      (ISO 10303-1304) specifies an application module for the
      representation of the state or status of a realized product. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The module may be used for recording the existance of faults on realized
      products, where  the fault is viewed as the state which exists
      after a failure event. An observed state may be related to the
      activity that was being performed when the state was recognized. 
      The observed state may be assessed against a state definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assignment of the observed state may be justified.  The
      module may also be used to assign a location to an 
      identified product or product group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The representation of the configuration of a realized product is
      provided by
      <module_ref
        linkend="Ap239_product_definition_information:introduction"/>
      (ISO 10303-1292).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <module_ref
        linkend="Ap239_product_definition_information:introduction"/>
      (ISO 10303-1292) specifies an application module for the
      representation of information that is the authoritative source for
      configuration definition information, it documents the product attributes
      and is the placeholder for the product requirements. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The following definitions and diagram show the relationship of product
      definition information, product operational information and how together
      they form product configuration information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Product definition information</b>
      defines the product requirements, documents the product attributes and
      is the authoritative source for configuration definition and control.
      It provides the technical basis for actions taken during all 
      product life cycle phases and for product validation and product
      operational information.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Product operational information</b>
     is derived from the product definition information. It consists of
     procedures and technical information needed by operators and support
     personnel to operate, maintain and dispose of the product including
     operating procedures, security procedures, maintenance procedures, spare
     parts lists, and disposal methods.

    <p>
      <module_ref linkend="Ap239_activity_recording:introduction"/>
      (ISO 10303-1287) specifies an application module for the
      representation of records of completed activities, including the use of
      resources. It extends the capability of 
      <module_ref linkend="ap239_work_definition:introduction"/> (10303-1307)
      using the module 
      <module_ref
        linkend="activity_as_realized:introduction"/>
      (10303-1259) to assert that the work
      described has actually taken place.  Capability is also provided to
      characterize the recorded activity, in term of who collected the
      information, under what circumstance; to identify the product on which
      work was performed, and to relate the recorded activity to the work order,
      work requests and work definition from which it arose.   In addition, the
      module enables the recording of observations to capture information which
      is not allowed for in the definition of the work.  Although much of the
      content of within this module relates to the use of 
      <module_ref linkend="Observation:introduction"/> (ISO 10303-1258), 
      this covers only a few per cent of the total capability, most
      of which is achieved by use from 
      <module_ref
        linkend="Activity_as_realized:introduction"/> (ISO 10303-1259) 
      and
      <module_ref
        linkend="Resource_as_realized:introduction"/> (ISO 10303-1269). 
    </p>

    <p>
      <module_ref
        linkend="Ap239_task_specification_resourced:introduction"/> 
      (ISO 10303-1306) specifies an application module for the
      representation of tasks with the associated resources,
      the assignment of tasks to products and the grouping and ordering
      of tasks.  The resource allocation, and the assignment to a product, may be
      qualified by a condition, a justification or a probability.  Locations may
      be assigned to tasks and resources. 
      A task is defined by a specification that provides the instructions for carrying out the work.
      The kinds of resources that may be defined for a task are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        products, either types of product or individual products;
      </li>
      <li>
        people, types of people, organizations, types of organization, or positions within organizations;
      </li>
      <li>
        documents and information held as files.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Task specifications may be assigned to products, product breakdown
      elements, zones and interfaces.  
      Conditions may be stated in terms of the state of the product, its
      age, its usage or any other parameter.  Justifications can be related to
      supporting data or documents. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This module thereby enables the definition and exchange of a
      computer interpretable description of the work required to support a
      complex engineered asset throughout its service life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The planning and scheduling of activities on individual products is out of scope.	   
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <module_ref linkend="ap239_work_definition:introduction"/> 
      (ISO 10303-1307) module specifies an application module for the
      representation of work to be performed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This module builds on the task specification resourced module by adding:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the capability to capture plans and schedules;
      </li>
      <li>
        the control of work through requests and work orders.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Plans and schedules are together known as schemes. 
      Schemes may have meta-data such who, when and why they were defined associated with them.
      Schemes may also have resources associated with them, either as a
      whole or with an entry within a scheme. 
    </p>
<p>
The second edition of this part of ISO 10303 incorporated the modifications to the first edition listed below.
</p>
<p>
The following ARM EXPRESS declarations and interface specifications have been added:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>USE FROM Analysis_characterized_arm</li>
 <li>USE FROM Conditional_effectivity_arm</li>
 <li>USE FROM Decision_support_arm</li>
 <li>USE FROM Extended_task_element_arm</li>

 <li>TYPE plcs_property_assignment_select</li>
 <li>TYPE plcs_requirement_assignment_item</li>
 <li>TYPE plcs_state_of_item</li>
 </ul>

   <p>
   In addition, modifications have been made to the mapping specification, 
   the MIM schema and the EXPRESS-G diagrams to reflect and be consistent with the modifications of the ARM.
