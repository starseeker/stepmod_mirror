 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of the Business Object model for ISO 10303-242, Managed model based 3d engineering.
     The information model of this part of ISO 10303 is on a higher
level of granularity than the ARM of ISO 10303-242 to be better
suited for the communication with and understandability by 
experts of the domains aerospace, defense and automotive. It consists of
Business Objects that represent major concepts and information
requirements of a subset of ISO 10303-242, Model based 3d
engineering. It uses the vocabulary of the STEP modules where this
vocabulary reflects the terminology of the domain experts;
otherwise, new vocabulary is introduced. The relationship between
the Business Object model and the ARM of ISO 10303-242 is
explained in this part of ISO 10303. A
technical discussion of the Business Object model is contained in
Annex H of ISO 10303-242.

<uof name="Configuration">
    <description>
This capability provides mechanisms to identify a single manufacturable product out of a large num-ber of variants. The main concepts that are used to handle this identification of a single manufacturable product are the following:
<ul>
<li>Product configurations are used to identify a manufacturable product out of a possibly large number of variants of a product class by its associated specifications without having an explicit representation of the product, e.g., a customer order for a car.</li>
<li>Product design association is used to associate an implicit representation of a manufacturable product (Product_configuration) with its explicit representation (Part_version).</li>
<li>Manufacturing configuration is used to specify the validity of occurrences of parts (Part_instance) with regard to manufacturing aspects in the context of an implicit as well as an explicit representation of a manufacturable product (Product_configuration, Part_version).</li>
<li>Configurations are used to configure part instances, alternative solutions, breakdown elements, and process plans in the context of the conditions (Class_condition_association, Class_specification_association) under which they are valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following business objects are used by this Capability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration;</li>

  </uof>
<uof name="Document Identification">
    <description>
This capability represents information concerning the management of documents and their versions.  A managed document is under revision control, and may distinguish various representation definitions of a document version.  The document version represents the minimum identification of a managed document under revision control.  Base document identification is always associated with at least one document version.  Multiple document versions of a base document identification may be related together to represent document version history, or to state that one document version is derived from another document version. Documents may be classified according to specific criteria.
<p>The following business objects are used by this Capability:</p>
<ul><li>Document;</li>
<li>Document_category;</li>
<li>Document_version;</li>
<li>Document_version_relationship.</li>
</ul>
    </description>
  </uof>
<uof name="Document Structure and Properties">
    <description>
This capability represents information concerning the relationships between document definitions and files, and the association of properties to documents and files.
Document structure on representation and file level is supported by defining relationships between Document_definitions or Files.

Document properties can be associated to representations of documents as well as to individual files. If document properties are assigned to representations of documents, the characteristics apply as well to all the constituent files of the document representation in most cases.  Some properties with numeric values, such as 'file size' and 'page count', applied to the document representation will not correspond to an individual file in a multiple file document representation, but to the sum of all the files that make up the particular document representation definition.  
<p>The following business objects are used by this Capability:</p>

<uof name="Effectivity">
    <description>
    The Effectivity capability represents information concerning the validity of data. Implicit propagation of data specifying validity is not available. The validity of data can be expressed by effectivities that specify, for example, time ranges within which data may be used. Explicit dates or dates expressed by events can be used in order to represent the relevant points in time. Validity may also be expressed for individual parts, which are identified by serial numbers.

  </uof>
<uof name="Materials">
    <description>
This Capability enables the representation of material by means of its properties and the association of material 
with products. The representation of the chemical structure of material is out of scope of this Capability.
<p>The following fundamental concepts and assumptions apply:</p>
<ul><li>material properties are defined by the environment that they are measured in;</li>
<li>such environments are described in terms of other types of properties;</li>
<li>material properties characterize some aspects of the behaviour of a product;</li>
<li>material properties are assigned to one or several materials, which may 
be associated with one or several products.</li>
</ul>
The following engineering considerations should be taken into account when using this Capability:
<ul><li>Material properties may be determined from measurements on the product as a whole, on a sample taken from 
the product in some way such as cutting, or an entirely separate test piece prepared by processing in the same 
way as the product. The application of the results derived from a test piece to the whole product is dependent on 
the relationship to the sample to the product because, as a result of the manufacturing process, the product 
may neither be homogeneous nor isotropic.</li>
<li>The values of most properties of a product are influenced by the effect that the manufacturing process has had on 
the product. The manufacturing process may affect the type and amounts of the units that make up the product and their 
form and arrangement. These units may be atoms, molecules or other aggregates of these in discrete forms such as crystals, 
fibres or volumes of semi-crystalline or glassy solids. The arrangement of the units is the material structure of the 
product.</li>
<li>The material structure of a solid product may be either homogeneous or heterogeneous, or a mixture of solids, 
such as in composite structures. A complete specification of the structure includes the relationship of any preferentially 
aligned elements of the structure to each other and to the product.</li>
</ul>
The following examples show how this Capability may be used:
<example number="1">A manufacturer may make a product to a specification and, instead of reporting actual measurements from a specific batch of the product, he may report the nominal value indicated in the specification.</example>
<example number="2">A chemist may perform calculations using assumed values of bond strengths to predict the strength of a polymer that has never been synthesised.</example>
<example number="3">An engineer performing a finite element analysis on a part might assign property values to predict potential product performance as a function of the property.</example>
<example number="4">A designer may specify material characteristics to achieve the required functionality of a part or to satisfy aesthetic or similar requirements.</example>
The following business objects are used by this Capability:
<ul><li>Data_environment;</li>
<li>Material_identification;</li>
<li>Material_property;</li>
