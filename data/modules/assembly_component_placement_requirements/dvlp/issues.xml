This module appears to be incomplete.  There is no reference to Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence that I can see and acpr_requirement_assignment_item does not appear to be used.  If this module is intended to use Lsro, then when that is added, the intro and scope will need to be updated to reflect category to category relationships
