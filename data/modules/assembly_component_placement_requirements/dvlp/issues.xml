This module appears to be incomplete.  There is no reference to Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence that I can see and acpr_requirement_assignment_item does not appear to be used.  If this module is intended to use Lsro, then when that is added, the intro and scope will need to be updated to reflect category to category relationships

looks like the Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence needs to be cloned
and the pca_product_design_object_category needs to be cloned.
maybe put pca_product_design_object_category clone in assembly_technology.

    There is the module interconnect_placement_requirements.
    However, the AO Assembly_spacing_requirement_occurrence may better be placed in
    the assembly_technology module relying on a similarity argument to fabrication_technology 
    module contents.
