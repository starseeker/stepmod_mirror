<ext_description linkend="Assembly_module_with_cable_component_arm.Cable_component"><p>
A <b>Cable_component</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_design_view:arm:Physical_unit_design_view_arm.Physical_component"/>. A <b>Cable_component</b> is an occurrence of a Cable.
A <b>Cable_component</b> shape may be defined by mappings of the shape of the two dimensional curve set or solid model found in the  <express_ref linkend="Cable:arm:Cable_arm.Cable_usage_view"/>.
There may be more than one segment to the two dimensional curve set or to the solid shape.
Placement of the shapes of the connectors and of the shapes of the  <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Axis_placement"/>, centreline curves, and extrusion solids from the usage view is accomplished with the use of Routed_cable_component_2d_shape or Routed_cable_component_3d_shape.
If a <b>Cable_component</b> is not referenced by a Routed_cable_component_2d_shape or a Routed_cable_component_3d_shape, then the shape of the  <express_ref linkend="Cable:arm:Cable_arm.Cable_usage_view"/> is being used with the same rigid body transformation style as a rigid component.
A <b>Cable_component</b> shape is represented in this part of ISO 10303 by directly referencing components placed in a usage view.
This reference is only for the purpose of exchanging shape information necessary for defining the assembly shape contribution of the cable component.
For bill of material information, the components in the cable usage view shall be ignored as the usage view is incomplete from a manufacturing perspective.
For the purposes of this standard, the solid representing a cable component need not be manifold.
</p><example>
Multiple segments may occur in the case where the cable has a branch resulting in three connectors.  In this case, the members of the curve set represent individual centreline shapes of each branch.
