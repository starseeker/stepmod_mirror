<ext_description linkend="Assembly_module_with_cable_component_2d_arm.Routed_cable_component_2d_shape">
A <b>Routed_cable_component_2d_shape</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_2d_design_view:arm:Physical_unit_2d_design_view_arm.Assembly_component_2d_shape"/>. A <b>Routed_cable_component_2d_shape</b> is the two-dimensional shape of a <express_ref linkend="Assembly_module_with_cable_component:arm:Assembly_module_with_cable_component_arm.Cable_component"/>.
The shape of the cable in the assembly may differ from the shape of the cable in the usage view only in the details of the curve set geometry.  The overall path length of any curve or segment shall not be different, and the direction of the curve or segment as it relates to the connector an end of the curve or segment is geometrically related to shall not change.  These constraints are supported by using Axis_placement_2d which provide both location and direction information as the items related by the <b>junction_placement</b> attribute.

the <b>shape_characterized_component</b> specifies the role of the <express_ref linkend="Assembly_module_with_cable_component:arm:Assembly_module_with_cable_component_arm.Cable_component"/> for the <b>Routed_cable_component_2d_shape</b>.

<ext_description linkend="Assembly_module_with_cable_component_2d_arm.Routed_cable_component_2d_shape.junction_placement">
the <b>junction_placement</b> specifies the role of the <express_ref linkend="Unknown:arm:Unknown_arm.Geometric_item_relationship"/> for the <b>Routed_cable_component_2d_shape</b>.  There may be more than one Geometric_item_relationship for the Routed_component_2d_shape.
The <b>junction_placement</b> specifies the set of relationships between Axis_placement_2d in the usage view shape and a correspond
ing Axis_placement_2d in the <b>Routed_cable_component_2d_shape</b>.
These relationships establish the relationships between end points of segments of the curve set that represents the cable.
These relationships establish the relationships between end point directions of segments of the curve set that represents the cable.
There may be more than one Geometric_item_relationship for the <b>Routed_cable_component_2d_shape</b>.
The items related by Geometric_item_relationship referenced by <b>junction_placement</b> shall only be Axis_placement_2d.
A <b>junction_placement</b> must be provided for each end point of each segment in the usage view that is desired to be related to a segment end point in the design view.  The <b>junction_placement</b> is optional and need not be provided.
<note>
Since the items related are Axis_placement_2d, there is no need for transformation matrix to transform from the source conte
xt into the target context.
