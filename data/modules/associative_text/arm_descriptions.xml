An <b>Associated_leader</b> is the association of a <b>Detailed_geometric_model_element</b> and a <b>Leader_curve</b> that ends on the geometric element. 
This association implies that a change in the definition of the <b>target_item</b> affects the <b>Associated_leader</b> in order to keep up consistency.
<example>If the <b>target_item</b> is a face and if the location of the face changes, then the leader will have to move in a way consistent with the movement of the face.
</example>
<note>The purpose of this entity is the connection of annotation information with the geometric element that is documented by this information.</note>
