    Product_in_slot
    Identifies the relationship between a Slot and a product that is capable to attach in the slot.
  </p>
  <p>
    The module does not seem to support the relationship between a slot and
    the product that is fitted to the slot. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I think that we need to have a "product_as_indvidual_in_slot" to
    represent the actual product that is fitted to the slot.

The relationship is provided by the next_assembly_usage relationship. 
I have corrected the definition.

Product_in_slot is a subtype of View_definition_usage, which is a subtype of View_definition_relationship, hence no action required.

Product_in_slot is a subtype of View_definition_usage.
What is the purpose of the inherited
  relating_view   related_view  attributes?
  Should they not be renamed/redeclared to:
related_view to product
relating_view to slot
</description>
<comment
   by=" Sean Barker" 
   date="2003-06-18">
<description>Resolved as sugggested. The question was raised, should Slot_on_product be modelled in a similar way to Product_on_slot? The suggestion was rejected because the definition for view_definition_usage includes "it is considered that the related product is used in the context of the relating product" ... this is true for Product_in_slot but I would say that Slot_on_product is about this "product" (slot) is a feature of this parent product.

The attributes:
  SELF\View_definition_relationship.related_view RENAMED product : Product_view_definition;
  SELF\View_definition_relationship.relating_view RENAMED slot : Slot_definition;
are the wrong way around.
It should be:

  SELF\View_definition_relationship.related_view RENAMED slot : Slot_definition;

A slot is only a specific view of a product. It is not a product or product_version by its own.

 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Totally re-model this module. Make entity slot a subtype of product_view_definition. Don't have specific subtypes from product and product_version.

  <p>
The industrial requirements of the PLCS member companies have identified
the requirement to identify and track versions of an attachment slot. The
slots have independently identified requirements and configuration
histories. Hence the subtyping of product and product version. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a military aircraft has a number of hard points to which
    various pylons can be attached which can carry a number of role
    equipments such as sensors, missiles, long range fuel tanks.
    During the life cycle of the aircraft, the attachment points on the
    pylon may evolve to provide more capability. E.g. be versioned.

 <p>
ARM entity "Slot" is defined in "Attachment_slot" module developed for AP239 as follows.

"A Slot is a type of Product that represents the position in which a part is or can be attached to a parent product."

There is another ARM entity "Slot" defined in AP224 with a different meaning in the domain of a numerical controlled machine. This may cause a problem if the next version of AP224 is planned to be developed using the modular architecture, namely one of these ARM entity names may have to be changed to avoid a name clash.
Does it mean that the ARM entity name in the later AM has to be changed even if it was established in the corresponding traditional AP?</p>

	Note: Slot appears in 11 extensible selects which require revision as will others - 77 in total. 
	Module needs to be revised.
	Tim King is editor. Another voluteer needed?

The use of product_category.name='attachment_slot' in the mapping is
incorrect. All mapping strings should contain whitespace not _.
