    Product_in_slot
    Identifies the relationship between a Slot and a product that is capable to attach in the slot.
  </p>
  <p>
    The module does not seem to support the relationship between a slot and
    the product that is fitted to the slot. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I think that we need to have a "product_as_indvidual_in_slot" to
    represent the actual product that is fitted to the slot.

The relationship is provided by the next_assembly_usage relationship. 
I have corrected the definition.

Product_in_slot should be a subtype of View_definition_relationship to
allow the application of Item_usage_effectivity.

Product_in_slot is a subtype of View_definition_usage, which is a subtype of View_definition_relationship, hence no action required.

Product_in_slot is a subtype of View_definition_usage.
What is the purpose of the inherited
  relating_view   related_view  attributes?
  Should they not be renamed/redeclared to:
related_view to product
relating_view to slot

<comment

   date="2003-06-18">
<description>Resolved as sugggested. The question was raised, should Slot_on_product be modelled in a similar way to Product_on_slot? The suggestion was rejected because the definition for view_definition_usage includes "it is considered that the related product is used in the context of the relating product" ... this is true for Product_in_slot but I would say that Slot_on_product is about this "product" (slot) is a feature of this parent product.
