    Product_in_slot
    Identifies the relationship between a Slot and a product that is capable to attach in the slot.
  </p>
  <p>
    The module does not seem to support the relationship between a slot and
    the product that is fitted to the slot. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I think that we need to have a "product_as_indvidual_in_slot" to
    represent the actual product that is fitted to the slot.

The relationship is provided by the next_assembly_usage relationship. 
I have corrected the definition.

Product_in_slot should be a subtype of View_definition_relationship to
enable the application of Configuration effectivity.
