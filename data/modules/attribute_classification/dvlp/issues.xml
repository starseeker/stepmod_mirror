  The name of the attributes "allowed_values" should be "allowed_value" and the
  name of the attribute "classified_entities" should be classified_entity.

<description>
It is not specified what happens to the inherited mandatory attributes of
entities in the mim. For example what value(s) are allowable for the
attribute_classification_assignment.role attribute that is inherited by
the applied_attribute_classification_assignment entity? The role attribute
in this case might be considered ambiguous to some. The guidelines
recommend values for these attributes may be documented in the "Module
implementation and usage guide" annex of the application module - but none
was found. I suggest that this is added with a list of the
entities/attributes concerned and marked for further assessment when a
usage guide is developed (else these will be lost until implementers begin
their work causing confusion later on).
