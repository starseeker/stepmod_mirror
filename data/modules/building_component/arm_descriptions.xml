rather than solid material. A <b>Negative_component</b> may be one of the following: a <b>Recess</b> or an <b>Opening</b>.
<note>The shape of a Negative_component is of concern only where it intersects a Positive_component.</note>
<example>A Negative_component in a wall could be a door opening. The relationship between
the Negative_component (the door opening) and the Positive_component (the wall) is the same as if the
shape of the Negative_component were subtracted using a solid boolean operation (a CSG solid modelling
operation) from the shape of the Positive_component.</example>
