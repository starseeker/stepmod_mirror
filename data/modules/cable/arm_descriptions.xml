A <b>Cable_usage_view</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_usage_view"/>.  A <b>Cable_usage_view</b> may provide detailed assembly data including location and orientation of connectors and location of cable centreline and junctions using geometric models that are annotation models. 

</p><note number="1">
The <b>Cable_usage_view</b> supports intellectual property protection.  A design organization can control the amount of data they provide to a licensee or purchaser by including only a specifically tailored set of data in a usage view.
</note>
<note number="2">
Shape information is provided by  <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_3d_shape:arm:Physical_unit_3d_shape_arm.Physical_unit_3d_shape"/> or by  <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_2d_shape:arm:Physical_unit_2d_shape_arm.Physical_unit_planar_shape"/>.  Shape of connector is provided by Assembly_component_2d_shape or by Assembly_component_3d_shape.  Shape of centreline curve is provided by annotated curve or by solid curve.

A <b>Cable_terminal</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Part_terminal:arm:Part_terminal_arm.Part_terminal"/>. 
A <b>Cable_terminal</b> is a mapping of an instance of <express_ref linkend="Assembly_module_with_packaged_connector_component:arm:Assembly_module_with_packaged_connector_component_arm.Packaged_connector_component_interface_terminal"/> to specify an interface terminal for a cable.  This mapping is maintained entirely in the Cable usage view.  If available, the <b>terminal_connection_zone</b> shall be supplied.  The mapping provides support for establishing end-to-end continuity specification for a Cable.

the <b>terminal_connection_zone</b> specifies a <express_ref linkend="Feature_and_connection_zone:arm:Feature_and_connection_zone_arm.Connection_zone"/> for the <b>Cable_terminal</b>. There may be more than one  <express_ref linkend="Feature_and_connection_zone:arm:Feature_and_connection_zone_arm.Connection_zone"/> for a <b>Cable_terminal</b>.  The <b>terminal_connection_zone</b> is optional and need not be supplied.  If the data is available in the source system, it shall be supplied.

the <b>mapped_terminal</b> specifies a <express_ref linkend="Assembly_module_with_packaged_connector_component:arm:Assembly_module_with_packaged_connector_component_arm.Packaged_connector_component_interface_terminal"/>  for the <b>Cable_terminal</b>.  The <b>mapped_terminal</b> is the interface terminal on a connector component in the usage view that is being assigned the role of the cable terminal.
