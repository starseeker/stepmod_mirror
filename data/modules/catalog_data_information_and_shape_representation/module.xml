	<purpose>
		<p>
This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of the data that identify and characterize products offered to market and of their components.
This application module provides also specifications suitable for the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of product components.
   </p>
   		<p>A furniture catalogue contains a list of references of pieces of furniture that are proposed to customers or to distributors. A catalogue provides a commercial view of the products of a furniture supplier but it does not represent the design information of the pieces of furniture. This application protocol enables to represent both kinds of information, using distinct data structures.</p>
		<p>It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.</p>
		<p>The core of the product model is catalogue information. This information is connected to other parts in order to define the geometry of the pieces of furniture and to select a set of product features.</p>
		<p> This application module provides the definition for the main information data of a catalogue,
such as the definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a piece of furniture that the customer can chose in order to select
one product from another. The structure of the product (modular pieces of furniture or just pieces of furniture that can be decomposed in its components),
the effectivity of the catalogue itself or the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) that gives additional information about the product
such as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a classification of the products in order they could be found easily in a catalogue depending on different search criteria; 
the properties of the product (not selectable by the user). It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalogue specification in the <module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO 1303-1103</module_ref> (Product class).
It also adds to the catalogue data information the capability of including the geometry of the products. It includes application modules for the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of product components, through subtypes of the generic type <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric Model</express_ref>.</p>

		<note>This application module is an extension of the Catalog_data_information module.
</note>
		<p>This application module specifies the schema associated with conformance class 2 of application protocol ISO 10303-236.</p>
