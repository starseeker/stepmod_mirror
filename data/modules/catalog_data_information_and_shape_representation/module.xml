A catalogue provides a commercial view of the products of a furniture supplier but it does not represent the design information of the pieces of furniture. This application protocol enables to represent both kinds of information, using distinct data structures.</p>		<p>It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.</p>		<p>The core of the product model is catalogue information. This information is connected to other parts in order to define the geometry of the pieces of furniture and to select a set of product features.</p>		<p> This application module provides the definition for the main information data of a catalogue,such as the definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a piece of furniture that the customer can chose in order to selectone product from another. The structure of the product (modular pieces of furniture or just pieces of furniture that can be decomposed in its components),the effectivity of the catalogue itself or the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) that gives additional information about the productsuch as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a classification of the products in order they could be found easily in a catalogue depending on different search criteria; the properties of the product (not selectable by the user). It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalogue specification in the <module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO 1303-1103</module_ref> (Product class).It also adds to the catalogue data information the capability of including the geometry of the products. It includes application modules for the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of product components, through subtypes of the generic type <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric Model</express_ref>.</p>		<note>This application module is an extension of the Catalog_data_information module.</note>		<p>This application module specifies the schema associated with conformance class 2 of application protocol ISO 10303-236.</p>	</purpose>	<!-- Items in scope -->	<inscope>		<li>product data definition;</li>		<li>catalogue product stucture;</li>		<li>modular products;</li>		<li>variants and options;</li>		<li>classification and specification control;</li>		<li>dimensions of shape elements;</li>		<li>price lists;</li>		<li>product configuration;</li>		<li>multi-language support;</li>		<li>approval;</li>		<li>effectivity;</li>		<li>documents definition and assignment;</li>		<li>product identified by its manufacturing configuration;</li>		<li>advanced boundary representation, faceted boundary representation, manifold surfaces with topology, geometrically bounded surface, geometrically bounded wireframe 2d and 3d geometry, wireframe with topology, and constructive solid geometry;</li>		<li>geometric validation properties, for the assessment of the quality of conversions that occur in a transfer of geometric data;</li>		<li>surface conditions;</li>		<li>geometric tolerance.</li>	</inscope>	<!-- Items out of scope -->	<outscope>		<li>work management data.</li>	</outscope>	<!-- <normrefs/> <definition/> <abbreviations/>-->	<!-- Clause 4 ARM  -->	<arm>		<!-- Note ARM short form EXPRESS is in arm.xml -->		<!-- Units of functionality -->		<uof name="CC2">			<description>		 The CC2 UOF specifies the data structure needed for the representation of complex marlketed products, of their components, 		 of their shape, of their properties and of their documentation.     </description>		</uof>		<!-- Short form EXPRESS-G -->		<express-g>			<imgfile file="armexpg1.xml"/>			<imgfile file="armexpg2.xml"/>		</express-g>	</arm>	<!-- ARM long form (optional) -->	<!-- If not required, delete this section and the following files:          arm_lf.xml          armexpg_lf1.gif          armexpg_lf1.xml -->	<arm_lf></arm_lf>	<!-- Clause 5.1 Mapping specification -->	<mapping_table>		<sc constraint="subtype_exclusiveness_geometric_model" entity="Geometric_model">			<rules>subtype_exclusiveness_shape_representation_geometry</rules>			<source>ISO 10303-1352</source>		</sc>	</mapping_table>	<!-- Clause 5.2 MIM -->	<mim>		<!--  Note MIM short form express is in mim.xml -->		<express-g>			<imgfile file="mimexpg1.xml"/>			<imgfile file="mimexpg2.xml"/>		</express-g>	</mim>		<!-- MIM long form (optional) -->	<!-- If not required, delete this section and the following files:          mim_lf.xml          mimexpg_lf1.gif          mimexpg_lf1.xml -->	<mim_lf></mim_lf></module>
