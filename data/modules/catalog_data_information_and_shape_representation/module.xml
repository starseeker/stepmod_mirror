A catalog provides a commercial view of the products of a supplier or manufacturer but it does not represent the design information of the commercial products. This application protocol enables to represent both kinds of information, using distinct data structures.</p>		<p>It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.</p>		<p>The core of the product model is catalog information. This information is connected to other parts in order to define the geometry of the commercial products and to select a set of product features.</p>		<p> This application module provides the definition for the main information data of a catalog,such as the definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a piece of commercial product  that the customer can chose in order to selectone product from another. The structure of the product (modular pieces of products or just products that can be decomposed in its components),the effectivity of the catalog itself or the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) that gives additional information about the productsuch as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a classification of the products in order they could be found easily in a catalog depending on different search criteria; the properties of the product (not selectable by the user). It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalog specification in the <module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO 1303-1103</module_ref> (Product class).It also adds to the catalog data information the capability of including the geometry of the products. It includes application modules for the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of product components, through subtypes of the generic type <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric Model</express_ref>.</p>		<note>This application module is an extension of the Catalog_data_information module.</note>		<p>This application module specifies the schema associated with conformance class 2 of application protocol ISO 10303-236.</p>	</purpose>	<!-- Items in scope -->	<inscope>		<li>representation of catalog of furniture product data definition;</li>		<li>representation of catalog furniture product stucture;</li>		<li>modular products as a representation of furniture related products;</li>		<li>furniture variants and options of furniture products;</li>		<li>furniture products classification and specification control;</li>		<li>furniture produtcs dimensions of shape elements;</li>		<li>representation of furniture products price lists;</li>		<li>different furniture product configuration based on specific characteristics;</li>		<li>multi-language support;</li>		<li>effectivity;</li>		<li>documents definition and assignment to describe furniture products;</li>		<li>product manufacturing configuration.</li>		<li>furniture product geometry including advanced boundary representation, faceted boundary representation, manifold surfaces with topology, geometrically bounded surface, geometrically bounded wireframe 2d and 3d geometry, wireframe with topology, and constructive solid geometry;</li>		<li>furniture product geometric validation properties, for the assessment of the quality of conversions that occur in a transfer of geometric data;</li>		<li>furniture surface conditions;</li>		<li>furniture geometric tolerance.</li>	</inscope>	<!-- Items out of scope -->	<outscope>		<li>work management data.</li>	</outscope>	<!-- <normrefs/> <definition/> <abbreviations/>-->	<!-- Clause 4 ARM  -->	<arm>		<!-- Note ARM short form EXPRESS is in arm.xml -->		<!-- Units of functionality -->		<uof name="CC2">			<description>		 The CC2 UOF specifies the data structure needed for the representation of complex marlketed products, of their components, 		 of their shape, of their properties and of their documentation.     </description>		</uof>		<!-- Short form EXPRESS-G -->		<express-g>			<imgfile file="armexpg1.xml"/>			<imgfile file="armexpg2.xml"/>		</express-g>	</arm>	<!-- ARM long form (optional) -->	<!-- If not required, delete this section and the following files:          arm_lf.xml          armexpg_lf1.gif          armexpg_lf1.xml -->	<arm_lf/>	<!-- Clause 5.1 Mapping specification -->	<mapping_table>		<sc constraint="subtype_exclusiveness_geometric_model" entity="Geometric_model">			<rules>subtype_exclusiveness_shape_representation_geometry</rules>			<source>ISO 10303-1352</source>		</sc>	</mapping_table>	<!-- Clause 5.2 MIM -->	<mim>		<!--  Note MIM short form express is in mim.xml -->		<express-g>			<imgfile file="mimexpg1.xml"/>			<imgfile file="mimexpg2.xml"/>		</express-g>	</mim>	<!-- MIM long form (optional) -->	<!-- If not required, delete this section and the following files:          mim_lf.xml          mimexpg_lf1.gif          mimexpg_lf1.xml -->	<mim_lf/></module>
