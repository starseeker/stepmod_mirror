    This AO is a copy of product_material_composition_relationship from part 45.
    I know of no application in electrical design where we have an explicit tolerance
    on bulk material in a bom.  suggest a subtype of Scr with a amount: SET[1:1]
    to support that case.
    also, need an ip that states that the members of amount (when there are more than
    one) need to be different complex instances of Value_with_unit and qualified_measure_schema AOs.
      I don't know where the requirement that Value_with_unit shall only be a ratio.
