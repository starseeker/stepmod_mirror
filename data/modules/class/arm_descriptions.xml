        A <b>Class</b> is a number of things considered together.
        <note number="1">
          In this part of ISO 10303, the term 'class' and 'set' are
          synonyms.
        </note>
      
        <note number="2">
          A class can consist of all things with a particular set of
          properties. Hence information about the consequences of
          possessing the set of properties can be assigned to the class. 
          <p>
            If a thing is classified as being a member of such a class,
            then a set of properties possessed by the thing can be
            deduced. 
          </p>
        </note>
        <note number="3">
          This entity may be instantiated as a compound instance involving
          another entity from ISO 10303. 
        </note>

        Each <b>Class</b> is a
        <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class_by_extension"/>
        or a
        <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class_by_intension"/>

        <note number="4">
          The distinction between a
          <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class_by_extension"/>
          and a
          <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class_by_intension"/>
          can be imprecise. For example, the set of
          items produced by a particular production run could be regarded
          as either. The entity type class is not specified as abstract, so
          an application protocol or application module can decide to
          ignore the distinction.
