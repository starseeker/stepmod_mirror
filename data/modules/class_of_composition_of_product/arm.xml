         <P>A <B>Class_of_composition_of_product</B> specifies a composition mapping
	 between classes of product.</P>
	 <P>The nature of a whole-part relationship between individual products may be
	 specified by indicating a class of composition of which it is a member.</P>
	 <example><P>'Centrifugal pump' is a class of product. 'Impeller'
	 is a class of product. The relationship between 'centrifugal pump' and
	 'impeller', that indicates a centrifugal pump has an impeller, is a
	 <B>class_of_composition_of_product</B>.</P>
	 </example>
	 <example><P>Pump model XYZ_123 is a class of product. Impeller
	 model I_123/A is a class of product. The relationship between pump model
	 XYZ_123 and impeller model I_123/A, that indicates a pump model has an impeller
	 of the type, is a <B>class_of_composition_of_product</B>.</P>
	 <P>At an instant in time, a pump of model XYZ_123 has 0 or 1 impeller of type
	 I_123/A. An impeller of type I_123/A is a member of 0 or 1 pump of model
	 XYZ_123.</P>
