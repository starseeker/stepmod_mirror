<P>A <B>Class_of_connection_of_activity</B> specifies a mapping between classes
of activity that indicates there are connection relationships between members
of the two mapped classes. A connection relationship indicates that there is a
flow of matter, energy or information.</P>
<P>The nature of a connection between individual activities may be specified by
indicating a <B>class_of_connection_of_activity</B> of which it is a member.
</P>
<example><P>The relationship 'maintain for operation' between:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the class of activity 'maintain mechanical equipment'; and</LI>
<LI>the class of activity 'operate mechanical equipment',</LI>
</UL>
<P>that indicates there is a flow of material objects, documents and
information in both directions between the two activities, is a
<B>class_of_connection_of_activity</B>.</P>
<P>The cardinality for this relationship is follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a maintain mechanical equipment activity is connected to zero one or many
operate mechanical equipment activities;</LI>
<LI>an operate mechanical equipment activity is connected to one or many
maintain mechanical equipment activities.</LI>
</UL>
</example> 
<note>The cardinality for the relationship is within the scope
of the <module_ref linkend="cardinality_of_relationship:1_scope">Cardinality_of_relationship</module_ref> application module.</note>
<note>This entity is identical to
<B>class_of_connection_of_individual</B> in ISO 15926-2, where the
relationship is between classes of activity.</note>
