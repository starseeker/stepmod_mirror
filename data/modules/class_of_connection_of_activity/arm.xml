<p>A <b>Class_of_connection_of_activity</b> specifies a mapping between classes
of activity that indicates there are connection relationships between members
of the two mapped classes. A connection relationship indicates that there is a
flow of matter, energy or information.</p>
<p>The nature of a connection between individual activities may be specified by
indicating a <b>class_of_connection_of_activity</b> of which it is a member.
</p>
<example><p>The relationship 'maintain for operation' between:</p>
<ul>
<li>the class of activity 'maintain mechanical equipment'; and</li>
<li>the class of activity 'operate mechanical equipment',</li>
</ul>
<p>that indicates there is a flow of material objects, documents and
information in both directions between the two activities, is a
<b>class_of_connection_of_activity</b>.</p>
<p>The cardinality for this relationship is follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>a maintain mechanical equipment activity is connected to zero one or many
operate mechanical equipment activities;</li>
<li>an operate mechanical equipment activity is connected to one or many
maintain mechanical equipment activities.</li>
</ul>
</example> 
<note number="1">The cardinality for the relationship is within the scope
of the <module_ref linkend="cardinality_of_relationship:1_scope">Cardinality_of_relationship</module_ref> application module.</note>
<note number="2">This entity is identical to
<b>class_of_connection_of_individual</b> in ISO 15926-2, where the
relationship is between classes of activity.</note>
