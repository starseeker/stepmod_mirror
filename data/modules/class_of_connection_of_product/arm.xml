         <P>A <B>Class_of_connection_of_product</B> specifies a connection mapping
between classes of product.</P>
<P>The nature of a connection between individual products may be specified by
indicating a class of connection of which it is a member.</P>
	 <example><P>The relationship 'pump suction pipe connection'
between:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the class of product 'pump'; and</LI>
<LI>the class of product 'pipe',</LI>
</UL>
<P>that indicates there is a suction side connection between a pump and a pipe,
is a <B>class_of_connection_of_product</B>.</P>
<P>At an instant in time, the cardinality for this relationship is follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a pump has zero (an immersed pump), one (usual) or many (through a
manifold) connections to a pipes on the suction side;</LI>
<LI>a pipe has zero, one or many (though a manifold) connections to the suction
side of pumps.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The connection between individual pump P_1001 and individual pipe FW_1001
can be classified as a 'pump suction pipe connection'.</P>
	 </example>
	 <note><P>The cardinality for the relationship is within the
	 scope of the <module_ref linkend="cardinality_of_relationship:1_scope">Cardinality of
relationship</module_ref> application module.</P>
	 </note>
	 <note><P>This entity is identical to
	 <B>class_of_connection_of_individual</B> in ISO 15926-2, where the
	 relationship is between classes of product.</P>
