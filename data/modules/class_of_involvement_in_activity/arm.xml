<p>A <b>Class of involvement in activity</b> specifies a mapping between a
class of activity and a class of product, document, organization or person that
indicates there is an involvement relationship between a member of the class of
activity and a member of the class of product, document, organization or
person.</p>
<p>The nature of an involvement of an individual product, document,
organization or person in an individual activity may be specified by indicating
a class of involvment of which it is a member.</p>
<example><p>The relationship 'stress analysis performer' between: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>the class of person 'stress engineer'; and</li>
<li>the class of activity 'stress analysis',</li>
</ul>
<p>is a Class of involvement in activity.</p>
<p>The cardinality for this relationship is follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>a stress engineer may be involved in zero, one or many stress analysis
activities;</li>
<li>a stress analysis activity has one or many stress engineers involved in it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The involvement of John Doe, who is a stress engineer at Joe Bloggs and Co.,
and the stress analysis of part XYZ_123 carried out on 2001-05-02, is
classified as 'stress analysis performer'.</p>
