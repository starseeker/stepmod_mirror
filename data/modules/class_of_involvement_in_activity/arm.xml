<P>A <B>Class of involvement in activity</B> specifies a mapping between a
class of activity and a class of product, document, organization or person that
indicates there is an involvement relationship between a member of the class of
activity and a member of the class of product, document, organization or
person.</P>
<P>The nature of an involvement of an individual product, document,
organization or person in an individual activity may be specified by indicating
a class of involvment of which it is a member.</P>
<example><P>The relationship 'stress analysis performer' between: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the class of person 'stress engineer'; and</LI>
<LI>the class of activity 'stress analysis',</LI>
</UL>
<P>is a Class of involvement in activity.</P>
<P>The cardinality for this relationship is follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a stress engineer may be involved in zero, one or many stress analysis
activities;</LI>
<LI>a stress analysis activity has one or many stress engineers involved in it.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The involvement of John Doe, who is a stress engineer at Joe Bloggs and Co.,
and the stress analysis of part XYZ_123 carried out on 2001-05-02, is
classified as 'stress analysis performer'.</P>
