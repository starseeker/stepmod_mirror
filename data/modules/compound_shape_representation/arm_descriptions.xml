	A <b>Compound_shape_representation</b> is a type of
	<express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model"/>.
	A <b>Compound_shape_representation</b> is a geometry model where elements of different dimensionality, 
	such as wireframe models or surface models, are topologically connected.
	The topology of a <b>Compound_shape_representation</b> may be non-manifold.
</p>
	<note>
		A <b>Compound_shape_representation</b> may include non-manifold surface models as well as 
		topologically bounded three-dimensional wireframe models.
