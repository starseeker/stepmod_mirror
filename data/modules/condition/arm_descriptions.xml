    A <b>Condition</b> is a definition of the precedent that must be fulfilled
    before a statement or relationship becomes valid. 

  <note>
    The condition is defined as a text based expression that is represented
    by the description attribute.
  </note>
  
  <p>
    The parameters against which the condition is to be evaluated are
    identified by 
    <express_ref linkend="condition:arm:Condition_arm.Condition_parameter"/>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The target or consequence of a condition is represented by
    <express_ref linkend="condition:arm:Condition_arm.Condition_assignment"/>.
  </p>
  <example>
    "If the engine has been running for 10000 hours then it requires a
    service" 
    is an example of a conditional statement. The conditional
    part of the statement is "If the engine has been running for 10000
    hours" which is stored in definition attribute on Condition.
    The parameter or subject of the condition is "the engine" which is
    represented by a 
    <express_ref
      linkend="condition:arm:Condition_arm.Condition_parameter"/>
    identifying the 
    <express_ref linkend="product_as_individual:arm:Product_as_individual_arm.Product_as_realized"/>
    which represents the engine.
    The consequence of the condition is "then it requires a service".
    This is represented by 
    <express_ref
      linkend="condition:arm:Condition_arm.Condition_assignment"/>
    identifying the task to perform the service, a
    <express_ref linkend="task_specification:arm:Task_specification_arm.Task_method"/>.

A <b>Condition_relationship</b> is a relation between two conditions.
  <note>
    The <b>Condition_relationship</b> normally represents a logical

  <example>
    "If the engine has been running for 10000 hours AND the engine is
