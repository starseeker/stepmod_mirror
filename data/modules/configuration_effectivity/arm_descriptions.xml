An <b>Item_usage_effectivity</b> defines an effectivity domain that constrains the use of a product with or within another product, in the context of a <B>Configuration_watched_item</B>.

<p>The <B>effectivity_domain</B> attribute identifies a domain of effectivity.
</p>

<p>The <B>item_usage_relationship</B> attribute identifies a relationship which characterizes the use of the product with or within another product.
</p>
<example>This relationship may be an assembly-component relationship or a make-from relationship.
</example>
The <B>resolved_configuration</B> attribute identifies an association between a <B>Configuration_watched_item</B> and a product that implements it.
This attribute establishes the context in which the item_usage_relationship is considered and constrained.
<p>When the effectivity domain is a range of serial numbers, the serial numbers considered are those of the <B>Configuration_watched_item</B>.
</p><p>When the effectivity domain is defined using a production lot number, the production lot considered is one of the <B>Configuration_watched_item</B>.
</p><p>When the effectivity domain is an interval of time, the interval of time considered is related to the production of the <B>Configuration_watched_item</B>.
</p>
<P></P>
<note>When no effectivity constraint is applied to a View_definition_usage, the validity or applicability status of this View_definition_usage is unknown.
</note>
