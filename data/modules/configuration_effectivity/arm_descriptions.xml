An <b>Item_usage_effectivity</b> defines an effectivity domain that constrains the use of a product with or within another product, in the context of a <b>Configuration_watched_item</b>.

<p>The <b>effectivity_domain</b> attribute identifies a domain of effectivity.
</p>

<p>The <b>item_usage_relationship</b> attribute identifies a relationship which characterizes the use of the product with or within another product.
</p>
<example>This relationship may be an assembly-component relationship or a make-from relationship.
</example>
The <b>resolved_configuration</b> attribute identifies an association between a <b>Configuration_watched_item</b> and a product that implements it.
This attribute establishes the context in which the item_usage_relationship is considered and constrained.
<p>When the effectivity domain is a range of serial numbers, the serial numbers considered are those of the <b>Configuration_watched_item</b>.
</p><p>When the effectivity domain is defined using a production lot number, the production lot considered is one of the <b>Configuration_watched_item</b>.
</p><p>When the effectivity domain is an interval of time, the interval of time considered is related to the production of the <b>Configuration_watched_item</b>.
</p>
<p></p>
<note>When no effectivity constraint is applied to a View_definition_usage, the validity or applicability status of this View_definition_usage is unknown.
</note>
