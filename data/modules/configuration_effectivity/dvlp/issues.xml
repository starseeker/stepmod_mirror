<p>The existing scope and introduction of this module does not really address what the module does. 
The module is about the use of effectivity in the identification of a product configuration i.e. how
a product is assembled, not about the effectivity of configuration
items.</p> 

<p>Because of this, configuration management experts in industry have
significant issues with the terminology used.   </p>

<p>Proposed Solution (Optional):</p>
<p>Replace the scope statement with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Specification of effectivity constraints applied to the configuration of a product.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>Replace the Introduction with:</p>
<p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
representation of the data that characterizes the effectivity constraints
applied to the use of products in a product configuration. </p>
