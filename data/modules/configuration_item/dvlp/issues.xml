  <description>
The reference of the mapping of Item_design_association to Product_version (as 
proposed_design) is wrong: it should reach product_definition_formation (and not 
product_definition)

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Module development

  <p>
    The existing  scope and introduction of this module does not really address what the module does. 
    The module is about the identification of a product configuration i.e. how
    a product is assembled, not about the identification of configuration
    items.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, configuration management experts in industry have
    significant issues with the terminology used.   
  </p>
  <p>
    The name of the entity Configuration_watched_item is confusing. A better
    name would be Product_configuration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proposed Solution (Optional):
  </p>
  <p>
    Replace the scope statement with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Identification of the configuration of a product for a given product concept.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Replace the Introduction with:
  </p>
  <p>
    This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
    representation of product configurations for a given product concept. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Rename Configuration_watched_item to Product_configuration.
  </p>
