	 A <b>transition_feature_solid</b> is a type of <b>shape_aspect</b> ,  <b>solid_model</b>,  and <b>selected_geometric_element</b>.  It is the result of a CAD operation on a <b>solid_model</b>, which blends two surfaces to create a transition surface on the new solid.  The <b>selected_geometric_element</b>  provides an attribute for identifying the edge to be used in the blending operation.  This edge is not part of the resulting solid, but must be captured to enable recreation of the <b>transition_feature_solid</b> in a receiving CAD system.

	An <b>edge_blend</b>  is a type of <b>transition_feature_solid</b> which provides a transition surface between two surfaces that intersect in an edge.  This entity is a <b>solid_model</b> in which the transition surface forms parts of its boundary.

An <b>edge_blend_fillet</b> is an <b>edge_blend</b> that provides a smooth surface as a transition between two surfaces that intersect in an edge, which is one of the boundary curves of a concave region.  The <b>edge_blend_fillet</b> operation adds material to the original <b>solid_model</b>.
