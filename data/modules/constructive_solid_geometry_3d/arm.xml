        An <b>Eccentric_cone</b> is a CSG primitive which is a
generalisation of the right circular cone. The <b>Eccentric_cone</b> may
have an elliptic cross section, and may have a central axis which is not
perpendicular to the base. Depending upon the value of the ratio attribute,
it may be truncated, or may take the form of a generalised cylinder. When
truncated, the top face of the cone is parallel to the plane of the base
and has a similar cross section.

      <description>
        A <b>Right_circular_cylinder</b> is a CSG primitive in the form of a solid cylinder of finite height. It is defined by an axis point at the centre of one planar circular face, an axis, a height, and a radius. The faces are perpendicular to the axis and are circular discs with the specified radius. The height is the distance from the first circular face centre in the positive direction of the axis to the second circular face centre.

      <description>
        A <b>Right_angular_wedge</b> can be envisioned as the result of intersecting a block with a plane perpendicular to one of its faces. It is defined with a location and local coordinate system. A triangular/ trapezoidal face lies in the plane defined by the placement X and Y axes. This face is defined by positive lengths x and y along the placement X and Y axes, by the length ltx (if nonzero) parallel to the X axis at a distance y from the placement origin, and by the line connecting the ends of the x and ltx segments. The remainder of the wedge is speci.ed by the positive length z along the placement Z axis which de.nes a distance through which the trapezoid or triangle is extruded. If ltx = 0. the wedge has fivve faces; otherwise, it has six faces.

        A <b>Right_circular_cone</b> is a CSG primitive in the form of a cone which may be truncated. It is defined by an axis, a point on the axis, the semi-angle of the cone, and a distance giving the location in the negative direction along the axis from the point to the base of the cone. In addition, a radius is given, which, if nonzero, gives the size and location of a truncated face of the cone.

        A <b>Cyclide_segment_solid</b> is a partial Dupin cyclide solid. This solid has two planar circular faces that in general have different radii and different normal directions. Around the boundary of each of these faces, the curved surface of the solid is tangent to a right circular cone.

      <description>
        A <b>Half_space_solid</b> is defined by the half space which is the regular subset of the domain which lies on one side of an unbounded surface. The domain is limited by an orthogonal box in the <b>Boxed_half_space</b> subtype. The side of the surface which is in the half space is determined by the surface normals and the agreement flag. If the agreement flag is TRUE, then the subset is the one the normals point away from. If the agreement flag is FALSE, then the subset is the one the normals point into.
        <p>
          For a valid <b>Half_space_solid</b>, the surface shall divide the domain into exactly two subsets. Also, within the domain, the surface shall be manifold and all the surface normals shall point into the same subset.
