  <ext_description linkend="Constructive_solid_geometry_3d_arm.Csg_model"><p>
A <b>Csg_model</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model"/>
 defined by a collection of  primitive solids, 
combined using regularised boolean operations. The allowed operations are intersection, union, and difference.</p> 
<note number="1">This entity is incompletely modelled in the ARM. Complete specification 
can be obtained in the definition of the corresponding MIM entity.
</note>
<note number="2">
As a special case, a <b>Csg_model</b> can also include a single CSG primitive.
</note>
<note number="3">
A regularised subset of space is the closure of its interior, in the usual sense of point set topology. 
For boolean results, regularisation has the effect of removing dangling edges and other anomalies produced by the original operations.
