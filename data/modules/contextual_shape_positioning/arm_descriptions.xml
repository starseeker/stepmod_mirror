A <b>Contextual_shape_representation_inclusion</b> is the association of the contextual shape of a product version with its positioned representation.
<p>
The position is expressed in the coordinate space of a geometric model representing the shape of the product version that uses the product version whose contextual shape is considered.
</p>
<p>
The positioned representation defines the representation of the contextual shape in that position.

A <b>Mapping_based_template_instance</b> is the replication of a <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric_model</express_ref>.
The replication transformation is defined by a source Axis_placement and a target that may be an Axis_placement or a Cartesian_transformation.
<p>In the first case, the transformation shall be computed as the isometric transformation that maps:</p>
<ul>
<li>the origin of the source onto the origin of the target;</li>
<li>the x_axis of the source onto the x_axis of the target;</li>
<li>the y_axis of the source onto the y_axis of the target.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second case, the transformation shall be computed as the transformation that maps:</p>
<ul>
<li>the origin of the source onto the translation point of the target;</li>
<li>the x_axis of the source onto the first element of the multiplication_matrix of the target;</li>
<li>the y_axis of the source onto the second element of the multiplication_matrix of the target.</li>
<li>in case the transformation is a 3D transformation, the normalised vector product of the x_axis and the y_axis of the source onto the third element of the multiplication_matrix of the target.</li>
</ul>
<note number="1">
In the case where the Geometric_coordinate_space of the replicated model is not the same as the Geometric_coordinate_space in which the Template_instance is founded, 
care shall be taken of any difference in the length units of both the instances of Geometric_coordinate_space, as unit conversion may be required.
</note>
        
<example>
In a technical drawing of a mechanical part with several identical drilling holes, 
the hole geometry, is represented by a circle named 'annotated drilling hole'. 
This representation of the hole is replicated several times 
at different locations by corresponding <b>Template_instance</b> objects.  
</example>

<note number="2">The mapping-table defines two interpretations for this ARM entity. The first one uses the MIM entity <b>mapped_item</b> which uses the same principle to define the transformation as the <b>Axis_placement_mapping</b> 
and <b>Axis_placement_transformation_mapping</b> entities. The second one uses the MIM entity <b>representation_relationship_with_transformation</b>. Although this latter entity is not semantically equivalent to the ARM entity, the second 
interpretation is kept because of its use in some implementations.
