<p><b>filled dot</b>: a graphical symbol depicted as a circle. The origin of the symbol is the centre of the circle. The area within the symbol is shaded. 

<p><b>integral symbol</b>: a graphical symbol depicted as one line segment forming two adjacent arcs. The origin of the symbol is the midpoint between the two arcs. 
</p>
<p><b>open arrow</b>: a graphical symbol depicted as three line segments which form an isosceles triangle where the third side of the triangle is blanked. The origin of the symbol corresponds to the intersec-tion point of the two equal sides. The annotation curve, to which the symbol is applied, acts as a bi-sector to the angle created by the two equal sides.
