<p>The <b>pre_defined_terminator_symbol</b>s are: 
</p><p>
blanked arrow: a graphical symbol depicted as three line segments which form an isosceles triangle. The origin of the symbol corresponds to the intersection point of the two equal sides. The annotation curve, to which the symbol is applied, acts as a bisector to the angle created by the two equal sides. The area within the symbol is blanked.
</p><p>
blanked box: a graphical symbol depicted as four line segments which form a square. Two opposite sides of the square are parallel to the annotation curve to which the symbol is applied. The origin of the symbol is the geometric centre of the square. The area within the symbol is blanked.
</p><p>
blanked dot: a graphical symbol depicted as a circle. The origin of the symbol is the centre of the circle. The area within the symbol is blanked. 
</p><p>
dimension origin: a graphical symbol depicted as a circle. The origin of the symbol is the centre of the circle. 
</p><p>
filled arrow: a graphical symbol depicted as three line segments which form an isosceles triangle. The origin of the symbol corresponds to the intersection point of the two equal sides. The annotation curve, to which the symbol is applied, acts as a bisector to the angle created by the two equal sides. The area within the symbol is shaded. 
</p><p>
filled box: a graphical symbol depicted as four line segments which form a square. Two opposite sides of the square are parallel to the annotation curve to which the symbol is applied. The origin of the symbol is the geometric centre of the square. The area that lies within the symbol is shaded.

filled dot: a graphical symbol depicted as a circle. The origin of the symbol is the centre of the circle. The area within the symbol is shaded. 
</p><p>
integral symbol: a graphical symbol depicted as one line segment forming two adjacent arcs. The origin of the symbol is the midpoint between the two arcs. 
</p><p>
open arrow: a graphical symbol depicted as three line segments which form an isosceles triangle where the third side of the triangle is blanked. The origin of the symbol corresponds to the intersec-tion point of the two equal sides. The annotation curve, to which the symbol is applied, acts as a bi-sector to the angle created by the two equal sides. 
</p><p>
slash: a graphical symbol depicted as a line segment with the midpoint of the segment being the ori-gin and lying on the annotation curve to which it is applied. 
</p><p>
unfilled arrow: a graphical symbol depicted as three line segments which form an isosceles triangle. The origin of the symbol corresponds to the intersection point of the two equal sides.
