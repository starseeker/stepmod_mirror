<ext_description linkend="Derived_shape_element_arm.Derived_geometry">
A <b>Derived_geometry</b> is the identification of a constructive geometric element that is derived from one or more aspects of a shape.
<note>This concept is primarily intended to be used in the representation of tolerancing and dimensioning constraints.</note>
<example>A plane of symmetry is an example of <b>Derived_geometry</b>, derived from a particular property of a shape of a part.</example>
