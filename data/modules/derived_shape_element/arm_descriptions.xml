A <b>Derived_shape_element</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="shape_property_assignment:arm:Shape_property_assignment_arm.Shape_element"/>. It represents a shape element derived from one or more other <express_ref linkend="shape_property_assignment:arm:Shape_property_assignment_arm.Shape_element"/>s.
<example>The centre plane of an ideal slot is an example of a <b>Derived_shape_element</b>, that is derived from a symmetrical feature of the shape of a part. Its shape is uniquely specified without further geometric description. </example></ext_description>
