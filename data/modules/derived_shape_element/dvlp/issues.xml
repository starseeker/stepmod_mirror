The name, intorduction and scope of the module appear to conflict with the model presented. Since it is not clear what the model is supposed to be about it is impossible to review it. It is therefore recommended that the module be REJECTED.

Scope
The term shape elements is not defined. The scope should be made clear. The term "Constructive geometry" is used. This term is liable to be confused with Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) and the scope should be clarified

ARM:Derived_geometry
A Derived_geometry is NOT an identifier. The definition needs rephrasing.

ARM:Derived_geometry
Note gives the opposite sense to derived geoemtry to that I would have expected. Either the scope of the module is very misleading, or the note is wrong.

ARM:Derived_geometry
The example is odd, since the shape is normally derived form a plane of symmetry, rather than the plane from the shape. The definitions suggest that either the name "derived_geometry" is unsuitable (perhaps "supporting_geometry") or that the clause is misleadingly phrased.

ARM:Derived_geometry
As there are more than two examples, they should be numbered.

ARM:Derived_geometry
The attribute "role" would be better replaced with a classification taken from an External class library

ARM:Offset_shape_element
The direction of offset is not specified. For example, if the base element being offset is a curve on a surface, is the offset normal to the surface, or normal to the line along the surface (and in which direction).

ARM:Offset_shape_element
The definition precludes the use of offsets for purposes other than dimensioning or tolerancing. Again, is this because the scope is badly phrased or because the definitions are badly phrased?

Mapping
Mapping disagrees with the definition.

Mapping/ ISO TC 184/SC4 N1190:2001(E) 201-08-29
A number of the mappings use the pattern for instatiating selects

X
Y=X
Y

rather than the more usual pattern

X
X=Y
Y

The guidlines for the development of mapping specifications, 2nd edition (ISO TC 184/SC4 N1190:2001(E) 201-08-29) is ambiguous in this area, and the formal definition of the syntax is wrong, since there seems to be no way to get from the overally mapping to the select constructs.

Mapping, general
No context is given for representation. This would help with the recovery of the infomation from the part 21 file or equivalent.
