The name, introduction and scope of the module appear to conflict with the model presented. Since it is not clear what the model is supposed to be about it is impossible to review it. It is therefore recommended that the module be REJECTED.

Scope
The term shape elements is not defined. The scope should be made clear. The term "Constructive geometry" is used. This term is liable to be confused with Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) and the scope should be clarified

ARM:Derived_geometry
Note gives the opposite sense to derived geoemtry to that I would have expected. Either the scope of the module is very misleading, or the note is wrong.

<description>
ARM:Derived_geometry
The example is odd, since the shape is normally derived from a plane of symmetry, rather than the plane from the shape. The definitions suggest that either the name "derived_geometry" is unsuitable (perhaps "supporting_geometry") or that the clause is misleadingly phrased.

Propose instead to apply classification in a higher module.   We should discuss where to put it.

ARM:Offset_shape_element
The direction of offset is not specified. For example, if the base element being offset is a curve on a surface, is the offset normal to the surface, or normal to the line along the surface (and in which direction).

<description>
ARM:Offset_shape_element
The definition precludes the use of offsets for purposes other than dimensioning or tolerancing. Again, is this because the scope is badly phrased or because the definitions are badly phrased?

Mapping/ ISO TC 184/SC4 N1190:2001(E) 201-08-29
A number of the mappings use the pattern for instatiating selects

X
Y=X
Y

rather than the more usual pattern

X
X=Y
Y

The guidelines for the development of mapping specifications, 2nd edition (ISO TC 184/SC4 N1190:2001(E) 201-08-29) is ambiguous in this area, and the formal definition of the syntax is wrong, since there seems to be no way to get from the overally mapping to the select constructs.

Reject. The modules conform to QCN241 because they require part 11 edition 2 mappings, which has passed ballot and is awaiting comments resolution.  QCN241 9.1.3 says &#x27;the name of the select type appears first followed by the equals sign and the member that is being selected.&#x27;  Agree that formal syntax in the informative annex is wrong.  
Check on syntax.

Modeling is in agreement with AP214.  However, I think this is a good point and needs some discussion.
Discuss context.

Not clear how to use Derived features. Examples are sparse.	
Add  more examples - perfect (eg axis of actual mating envelope - best fit of ideal cylinder to actual part ) vs imperfect (derived median - the union of centroids of pairs of opposing points).
Or - create capability to use reference data from a  tolerancing standard

<comment

   date="04-02-04">
<description> The question for this module is - should we try and limit is applicability - or should that be passed on to a using AP.   In GDT Engineering standards, Derived seems to be limited to  median lines (curves) , points, planes (surfaces) of features that are (nominally) symmetrical .   AP214 Derived_geometry can be any Part 47  derived_shape_aspect, which is more general - tangents, extensions, parallel offset, etc.   It is not clear if this concept is intended in AP214 to  apply to  construction of geometric representations of features from primitive points, lines, etc, this seems more in the province of Construction_geometry.
