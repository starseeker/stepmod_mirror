The current capability for add, change, delete are too limiting to support existing delta eda structures.
<p>There is a need to identify an aggregate in addition to a product definition to which an item is to be added,
deleted.
</p>
<p>
Example:
Add a terminal to Physical_connectivity_definition.associated_terminals
</p>
<p>
Example:
Delete a terminal from Generic_physical_network.connectivity_requirement_element
</p>

Here is the list of specific things normal EDA design changes file supports:
<p>
Add a component to a design,
Delete a component from a design,
Rename an existing component (ref des),
Change the location, orientation of a component,
Change the definition of a component,
Chagne the catalog data of a component (part actually),
Add a terminal to a functional unit node, physical connectivity definition, or parts connected terminal definition, or a physical net.
Delete a terminal to a functional unit node, physical connectivity definition, or parts connected terminal definition, or a physical net.
Merge two of functional unit node, physical connectivity definition, or parts connected terminal definition, or a physical net into one of those
(keeping the type the same).
Create a new functional unit node, physical connectivity definition, or parts connected terminal definition, or a physical net.
Split one of functional unit node, physical connectivity definition, or parts connected terminal definition, or a physical net into two of
functional unit node, physical connectivity definition, or parts connected terminal definition, or a physical net (keeping the same types).

rename an existing functional unit node, physical connectivity definition, or parts connected terminal definition, or a physical net.

change the pin-swap and other properties of a terminal.

Add, delete or change the value of a property on components, nets, terminals.
</p>
<p>
change the values of the context properties for shape (i.e., physical-unit_planar_shape.environment).

The current capability for add, change, delete are too limiting to support existing delta eda structures.
<p>There is a need to identify a sequence in which the deltas are applied.
