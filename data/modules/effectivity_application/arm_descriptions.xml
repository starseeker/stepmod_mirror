The <b>effectivity_item</b> type is an extensible list of alternate entity data types. 
It provides a mechanism to refer to instances of the data types included in the types that extend the <b>effectivity_item</b> type. 
<note>This empty extensible select type requires extension in a further module, to ensure that any entity data type that refers to it can have a valid instantiation.
