   <b>SC4 part number:</b>  </p>
 <p>
   <b>(2) Clause:</b> 10303-1004 4.3.9 Axis_placement_mapping and 4.3.10 Axis_placement_transformation_mapping
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(3) Paragraph:</b> 
 </p>

   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
This issue is on the old dispute on mapped_item and representation_map on the one hand and representation_relationship_with_transformation and item_defined_transformation on the other hand. Which one is the right or correct one to use?
The point is that we need two different ways to geometrically relate 2 objects with each other (with transformation). The difference between the two ways is that one establishes a geometrical assembly  (this is one shape is included in the other) while the other way only establishes a relation without including one shape in the other.
As an example let us assume a geometric_model A of a house with garden and parking place. There is another geometric model B of a car. Now we want to geometrically relate A and B to show how the car fits to the parking place. Neither is A is included in B nor is B included in A.
It is essential that both ways are supported by part 1004.</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Proposal A which is conformant with the AIM:
Introduce the mapped_item + representation_map concept in the ARM because this clearly defines inclusion of one representation in the other. For the case that only two representations shall be related with each other without establishing an inclusion use the representation_relationship_with_transformation.
Proposal B:
Rename both 4.3.9 and 4.3.10 to be just a relation instead of a mapping. When using these entities we can then defined whether they define an inclusion or just a simple relation.</p>

Closed during WG3/12 meeting in Seattle.  Put a SEDS against part 43, that also affects part 1027, to define a subtype of representation_relation_with_transformation that explicitly notes direction and composition and to implement in a module.

Once part 43 is modified, future APs  encouraged to adopt it.

 <p>
The mapping is incomplete:
cartesian_transformation_operator_3d &lt;= cartesian_transformation_operator
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis1 -&gt; direction]
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis2 -&gt; direction]
[cartesian_transformation_operator_3d.axis3 -&gt; direction]
</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Should be fixed to:
cartesian_transformation_operator_3d &lt;= cartesian_transformation_operator
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis1 -&gt; direction]
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis2 -&gt; direction]
[cartesian_transformation_operator_3d.axis3 -&gt; direction]
direction</p>

Different fix needs to be made. Proposal:
[cartesian_transformation_operator_3d &lt;= cartesian_transformation_operator
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis1 -&gt; ]
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis2 -&gt; ]]
[[cartesian_transformation_operator_3d.axis3 -&gt; ]]

			Remove reference path from both alternatives of this mapping, because it is redundant and erronous (starts from wrong entity).
