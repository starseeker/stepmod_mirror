An Envelope provides an historical record of the transmission of a message. It is used to record the audit data for sending and acknowledging a Message. Because it
is an historical record, each envelope is only used once, and so is not versioned.

<ext_description linkend="Envelope_arm.Envelope.acknowledge">
    the acknowledge attribute is used to ask for and provide
    acknowledgement of receipt of the envelope. On transmission of a message,
    <b>acknowledge</b> shall take one of the values "" (blank), "ask message arrival" or "ask message read". 
    A blank value expects no reply. A value of "ask message arrival" asks
    if the message arrived at the recepients' mailbox, and requires the reply
    envelope to have values "acknowledge arrival" if the message arrives at the
    destination <b>organization_or_person_in_organization</b>, or "delivery failure" if failure of the delivery is detected. 
  <note number = "1"> <b>Envelope</b> is used to provide an audit trail. There is no assumption that the transmission system has any knowledge of <b>Envelope</b> or its usage. However, if it reports some failure, this can then be recorded in the way described. </note>
A value of "ask message read" asks if the recipient has actually opened the <b>Message</b> to read it, and expects the reply "acknowledge read" on success, or "contents corrupt" if it is not possible to for it to be read.

<note number = "2"> For any single <b>Envelope</b>, there should be an acknowledgement per recipient. The acknowledgement will not contain a <b>Message</b>.</note>

<note number="3"> The <b>Envelope</b> being acknowledged is referenced using an <b>Envelope_association</b>.</note>

  an identifier for the <b>Envelope</b>.
