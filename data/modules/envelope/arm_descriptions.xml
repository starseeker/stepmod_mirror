An Envelope provides an historical record of the transmission of a message. It is used to record the audit data for sending and acknowleding a Message.

<ext_description linkend="Envelope_arm.Envelope.acknowledge">
The acknowledge attribute is used to ask for and provide acknowledgement of receipt of the envelope. On transmission of a message, <b>acknowledge</b> may take the values "" (blank), "ask message arrival" or "ask message read".
A blank value expects no reply. A value of "ask message arrival" asks if the message arrived at the recepients' mailbox, and requires the reply envelope to have values "acknowledge arrival" if the message arrives at the destination <b>organization_or_person_in_organization</b>, or "delivery failure" if failure of the delivery is detected.
<note> <b>Envelope</b> is used to provide an audit trail. There is no assumption that the transmission system has any knowledge of <b>Envelope</b> or its usage. However, if it reports some failure, that can then be recorded in the way described. </note>
A value of "ask message read" asks if the recipient has actually opened the <b>Message</b> to read it, and expects the reply "acknowledge read" on success, or "contents corrupt" if it is not possible to for it to be read.
<note> For any single <b>Envelope</b>, there should be an acknowledgement per recipient. The acknowledgement will not contain a <b>Message</b>.</note>

<ext_description linkend="Envelope_arm.Envelope.acknowledging_envelope">
In the case of an <b>Envelope</b> being sent as an acknowledgement, this will hold the value of <b>Envelope.id</b> of the original <b>Envelope</b>, otherwise it is not used.
<note> In the context of a database, this attribute is redundant, however in the context of a file being transmitted, it is required. </note>

<ext_description linkend="Envelope_arm.Envelope.id">
An identifier for the <b>Envelope</b>.
<note> The id is used to identify which <b>Envelope</b> an acknowledgement is referring to. While this needs to be unique, the scope of uniqueness is problematic, since, for example, the scope may be all the NATO defence organisations and their suppliers. </note>

<ext_description linkend="Envelope_arm.Envelope_association.role">

This may be used to define the role the relationship takes.
<example> If Envelope with id = 123 gets is acknowledged by Envelope id = 246, then Envelope_association.relating points to Envelope.id=123, Envelope_association.relating points to Envelope.id=246 and Enveloped_association.role="acknowledges".</example>
