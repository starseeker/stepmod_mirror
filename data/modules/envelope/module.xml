 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of Envelope.
An envelope is a wrapper for a message. It is provided in order to maintain an audit trail of transmission. Previously, audit trail information has been held externally to the STEP environment. However increase volumes and frequency of transaction, particularly of small extracts from a database, require the association of transmission information with the database. For example, in an automated support environment, failure to notify significant defects, maintenance actions or procedural changes may be legally significant.
	Just as with a physical letter where the envelope is quite distinct from the content, in this module, the envelope is quite distinct from the message it contains. However, the analogy should not be pushed too far. For example, in the envelope module, provision is made to use the envelope to send back receipts.
