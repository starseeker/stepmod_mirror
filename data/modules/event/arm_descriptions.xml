An <b>event_item</b> type is an extensible list of alternate entity data types. 
It provides a mechanism to refer to instances of the data types included in the types that extend the <b>event_item</b> type. 
<note>This empty extensible select type requires extension in a further module, to ensure that any entity data type that refers to it can have a valid instantiation.

the string that defines the kind of relationship that is specified.
<p>Where applicable, the following values shall be used:</p>

<li>'actualization': The relationship specifies that the relating <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event"/> identifies a predicted or planned event and the related <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event"/> identifies the point in time when that event actually occurred. 
This relationship is valid if the <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event.actual_start_date"/> attribute of the relating <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event"/> is not specified and the <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event.actual_start_date"/> attribute of the related <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event"/> is specified, or, if both these attributes are specified and equal;</li>
<li>'exclusiveness': The relationship specifies that the relating and the related <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event"/> shall not have any overlap during their duration; 
</li>
<li>'sequence': The relationship specifies that the relating <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event"/> shall be completed before the related <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event"/> starts; 
</li>
<li>'simultaneity': The relationship specifies that that both the relating and related <express_ref linkend="event:arm:Event_arm.Event"/> are considered as occurring during the same time period or shall be performed together in order to ensure consistency and enhance efficiency.

<note>The criteria for 'simultaneity' and in particular the allowed delay between two events declared simultaneous, are user-dependent.
