		<description>The ARM entity experience_gained should also map to an experience_type_experience_assignment subtype of experience_type_assignment and the experience_of attribute should map to the PATH from experience_type_experience_assignment to experience via an experience_item select type.</description>

		<description>
  The ARM does not support the incremental gaining of experience.
  Experience_type should be pointed to by Experience_instance (as expereince_of). Expereince_gained should then connect to Expereince_instance with the lollypop reversed, and should be classified as to a role. The defined_methods should come out of experience_type, not Experience_instance, and perhaps should also reference Activity and Task_method. If Experience Instance references anything, then it
should be activity_actual and Resource_as_realized.

		<description>
  The assignment of date/time data to experience_gained would seem to be redundant (and potentially contradictory) given that date/time data is already assigned to experience_instance.  Suggest removal of the relevant SELECT relationship.
