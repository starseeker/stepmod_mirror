  <description>
  The ARM does not support the incremental gaining of experience.
  Experience_type should be pointed to by Experience_instance (as expereince_of). Expereince_gained should then connect to Expereince_instance with the lollypop reversed, and should be classified as to a role. The defined_methods should come out of experience_type, not Experience_instance, and perhaps should also reference Activity and Task_method. If Experience Instance references anything, then it
should be activity_actual and Resource_as_realized.
