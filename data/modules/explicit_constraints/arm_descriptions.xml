A <b>Free_form_assignment</b> is a type of

that represents the assignment of a value,
the current value of a mathematical expression involving model parameter instances, to one or more
specified variational parameter instances. The value of the expression in the exchange model is obtained by evaluating it with the current values of all parameters involved in it. In the context of this entity data type, variational parameter instances involved in the expression are regarded as reference elements. The value of the expression is assigned to the value attribute of one or more constrained variational parameter instances.

<note number="2"> A <b>Free_form_assignment</b> is always a directed constraint. In editing a model containing such a constraint,

<note number="2">A <express_ref linkend="explicit_constraints:arm:Explicit_constraints_arm.Free_form_relation"/> may represent a directed constraint, an undirected constraint or some combination
of the two (hybrid constraint). If only one constrained element is present, the constraint will always be directed. If no reference element is present the constraint will be undirected. However, if more than one constrained element is present, together with one or more reference elements, some freedom will generally remain in the determination of the values of the constrained elements after satisfaction of the constraint relation. In such a case, what remains is an undirected relationship in which one or more of the constrained element values may be changed and the others should adjust accordingly.
