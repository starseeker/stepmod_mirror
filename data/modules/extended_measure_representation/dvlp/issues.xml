1106 has rules - we were not going have rules for the lowest level modules?  Oversight?

<description>
there is a legend running in SC4 that says that there shall be no rule in base modules.
 
This is not true. There are and will be rules in base modules, but not any kind of rules.
 
The rules you may find in base modules are those that maps a particular constraint of the ARM, that is specific to a construct of that module and/or that shall not be contradicted by another constraint in another module used simultaneously with the first module in a same CC.
 
On the other hand, rules that may be contradicted in another module shall not be included in a base module.
For example, a rule that requires that any instance of product is approved, shall not be included in Product_identification but in a CC or AP module.
 
The major reason to have a rule in a base module is that we do not have to duplicate and don't risk to forget to duplicate that rule in every module that uses the considered module.
 
 
For example, in extended_measure_representation, we want to restrict the composition of subtypes of representation_item. It makes sense to define the rules (which in that case could be subtype_constraints) in extended_measure_representation, as the constraints they define are general and as it would make no sense that another module allows the compositions that are forbidden by these rules.

Accept and fix except for " Error Map34: ERROR in subtyping in PATH: representation_item is not a supertype of Measure_item." This is due to error checking software not recognizing a SUPERTYPE mapping template.

<p>Ballot comment</p>
<p>Presently, EPM parser raises the following error for double_toleranced_measure_item:
ERROR : Line 1037: Illegal attribute redeclaration.
Redeclaring attribute: DOUBLE_TOLERANCED_MEASURE_ITEM.ITEM_ELEMENT in line: 1037
Redeclared attribute: COMPOUND_REPRESENTATION_ITEM.ITEM_ELEMENT in line: 28770
Redeclaration from aggregate type to simple type is illegal</p>
<p>Proposed change</p>
<p>Change to the following (this solution was recommended by Phil Spiby and Pascal Huau)

TYPE list_of_two_representation_items = list_representation_item;
WHERE
HIINDEX(SELF) = 2;
END_TYPE;

ENTITY double_toleranced_item
 SUBTYPE OF (compound_representation_item);
  SELF\compound_representation_item.item_element :
list_of_two_representation_items ;
DERIVE
  tolerance_range : value_range :=
SELF\compound_representation_item.item_element[2];
  toleranced_measure_value : measure_representation_item :=
SELF\compound_representation_item.item_element[1];
END_ENTITY;

Accept. Howver, when fixed as proposed, parser still raised an error. So I fixed as proposed except that the DERIVE is replaced with two informal propositions. </description>
