There does not seem to be a way to map the name of the External_class_library.

Proposal from Pascal Huau:
  <p>
    In AP214, external_library_reference is mapped onto
    externally_defined_class, which is an indirect subtype of group that has a
    name attribute. So, I do not see any major problem to have an id + a
    name (optional)

Rob Bodington response:
  <p>
    In AP214 external_library_reference  mixes the id of the class and the
    type of the library. It does not (as far as the AP214 description goes)
    enable the identification of the library that is holding the definition
    of a class.  
    It just has:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.2.188.2 external_id</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The external_id specifies the unique identifier of the referenced entry
    in the external library.  
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.2.188.3 library_type</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The library_type specifies the type of library that is used.
    So it mixes the identification of the class with the identification of the
    library - though the only identification of a library is through
    library_type attribute which maps to external_source.source_id  
  </p>
  <p>
    The group name is the name of the class not the library.
