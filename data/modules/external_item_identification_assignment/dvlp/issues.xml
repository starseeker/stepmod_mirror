	  <p>The text description says: An External_source_identification is the identification of the source where an item, that is not fully represented in a population of instances of EXPRESS entity data types but is only referred to, or the components of such an item, can be found. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  The phrase: "that is not fully represented in a population of instances of EXPRESS entity data types but is only referred to," places an undue limitation on the use of External_source_identification. Suggest removing phrase.
