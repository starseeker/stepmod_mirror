4.3.4 Line with class, 4.3.5 Pitch class should be subtypes of Class.  Are there other classes in AP210 that should be similarly integrated (I seem to remember seeing them)?

March 30, 2005 agree that these two classes should be subtypes of Class.  Action for Giedrius to investigate mapping and identify issues for Tom and Lothar to resolve. 

Giedrius wrote: Line_width_class mapps to styled_item (kind of representation_item) Pitch_class mapps to representation. While ARM Class mapps to AIM class (kind of group). So if we want to make Line_width_class and Pitch_class subtypes of Class - mappings will change a lot. Let me know if we had to do so anyway."
LK: What do do ?
TT: We want to make the change but defer to CD ballot comment
