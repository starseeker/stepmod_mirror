      <description>
A faceted_brep_shape_representation is a type of shape representation in which the representation items are specialisations of faceted brep entities. These differ from the more general B-rep in having only planar faces and implicit edge geometry.

            The call to function msb shells in IP2 and IP3 is correct
since, although the generic type of the argument `fbrep' is representation
item, `fbrep' has been selected by QUERY to be a subtype of manifold solid
brep.

      <description>
If a mapped item is included in the items set then the mapped representation of the mapping source attribute shall be a faceted brep shape representation.

        <note number="2">
          If a cartesian transformation operator 3d is included as mapped
item.mapping target with an axis2 placement 3d that corresponds to the
original co-ordinate system as mapped representation.mapping origin, then
the resulting mapped item is a transformed copy of the faceted brep shape
representation. The precise definition of the transformation, including
translation, rotation, scaling and, if appropriate, mirroring, is given by
the transformation operator.
