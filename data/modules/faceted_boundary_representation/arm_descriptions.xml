	 A <b>Faceted_brep_shape_representation</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model"/>. 
	 It is a collection of solids described by their envelopes represented with planar polygonal facets.

	 <p>
	 Each envelope is defined by at least for facets.
	 The topological normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the infinite region.

	 <note>This entity is incompletely modelled in the ARM. Complete specification 
can be obtained in the definition of the corresponding MIM entity.
