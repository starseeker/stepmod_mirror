	 A <b>Faceted_b_rep_shape_representation</b> is a type of <b>Geometric_model</b>. 
	 It is a collection of solids described by their envelopes represented with planar polygonal facets.

	 <p>
	 Each envelope is defined by at least for facets.
	 The topological normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the infinite region. 
	 </p>
	 <note>This entity is incompletely modelled in the ARM. Complete specification 
can be obtained in the definition of the corresponding MIM entity.
