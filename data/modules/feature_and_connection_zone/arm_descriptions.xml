<p>
		A <b>Connection_zone</b> is a type of 
	<express_ref linkend="Shape_feature:arm:Shape_feature_arm.Shape_feature_occurrence"/>. 
	A <b>Connection_zone</b> is also either a type of 
	<express_ref linkend="Shape_feature:arm:Shape_feature_arm.Instanced_feature"/>
	or is a type of
	<express_ref linkend="Shape_feature:arm:Shape_feature_arm.Placed_feature"/>.	 	
	A <b>Connection_zone</b> is an area on the surface of a design object that 
	may be used to establish electrical or physical connectivity with another design object.  
	A <b>Connection_zone</b> shape is defined in the shape definition of the feature that references the <b>Connection_zone</b>.  
</p>
	<note number="1">
		This part of ISO 10303 does not provide for unique identification of <b>Connection_zone</b> so references
		to a <b>Connection_zone</b> should be explicit or should explicitly reference the geometric model transformation
		that places the geometric model of the <b>Connection_zone</b> in a geometric model of a feature or view.
	</note>
	<note number="2">
	    The majority of applications will be the case where a <b>Connection_zone</b> is also
	    an <express_ref linkend="Shape_feature:arm:Shape_feature_arm.Instanced_feature"/>.
	</note>
	<example>
	    A <b>Connection_zone</b> defined in a design automation component data library would be defined in the geometric model of
	    the terminal and so would be also an instance of 
	         <express_ref linkend="Shape_feature:arm:Shape_feature_arm.Instanced_feature"/>.
	 </example>
