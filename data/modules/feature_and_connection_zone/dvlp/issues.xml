<p>WR1 is stating that the connection zone shall be referenced. The comparison operator should not be ">=" but should be ">".

The statement : "All points in a Connection_zone shall be topologically connected." is actually coming from an IP in the SGML model.
This problem occurred as a result of editing in the summer.  It should be included in a separate IP.
