The EXPRESS implementation of this rule is weak.

<p>WR1 is stating that the connection zone shall be referenced. The comparison operator should not be ">=" but should be ">".

<p>
The statement : "All points in a Connection_zone shall be topologically connected." is actually coming from an IP in the SGML model.
This problem occurred as a result of editing in the summer.  It should be included in a separate IP.

There is some special xml syntax required in arm.xml so that the IPs may show up in the browser in index.xml.
An email was sent out describing this.  There are two IPs in this module that need it.

This module needs the following SELECT TYPE added:
  	TYPE facz_analytical_model_port_assignment_select = EXTENSIBLE GENERIC_ENTITY SELECT BASED_ON analytical_model_port_assignment_select WITH  
 		(Connection_zone);
	END_TYPE;
(see the change detail in application_protocol.xml)
I will update the express after we publish to wg3.
