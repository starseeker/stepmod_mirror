	<purpose>
		<p>

This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of the data that identify and characterize products offered to market and of their components.

This application module provides specifications suitable for the representation of any kind of such products.

In particular, this application module enables the representation of products proposed to market with a great number of variants and whose composition is characterized due to the selection among a set of different product features. 

 </p>
		<example>Examples of such products are the products developed by the furniture industry, the automotive industry and the commercial airplane industry.</example>
		<p>This application module specifies the data types and their constraints. It specifies the conformance class 1 of ISO 10303-236.

</p>
		<p>A catalogue contains a list of references of different commercial products that are proposed to customers or to distributors. A catalogue provides a commercial view of the products of a supplier or manufacturer but it does not represent the design information of the commercial products.</p>
		<p>It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.</p>
		<p>The core of the product model is catalogue information. This information is connected to other parts in order to define the geometry of the products and to select a set of product features.</p>
		<p> This application module provides the definition for the main information data of a catalogue,

such as the definition of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a product that the customer can chose in order to select

one product from another). The structure of the product (the product itself or the decomposition of the product in its components),

the effectivity of the catalogue itself or its products, the effectivity of the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) that gives additional information about the product

such as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a classification of the products in order they could be found easily in a catalogue depending on different search criteria; 

the properties of the product (not selectable by the user). It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalogue specification in the <module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO 1303-1103</module_ref> (Product class).

It also adds to the catalog data information the capability of including the geometry of the products. It includes application modules for the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the shape of product components, through subtypes of the generic type <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric Model</express_ref>.</p>
		<p>In particular, this application module enables the representation of products proposed to market with a great number of variants and whose composition is characterized with expressions of operands selected in a set of product features.</p>
