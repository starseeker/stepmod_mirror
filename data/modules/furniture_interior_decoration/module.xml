	<!-- Introduction -->
	<purpose>
		<p>
		This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of the data that identify 
		and characterize products offered to market and of their components. This application module provides 
		specifications suitable for the representation of any kind of such products. In particular, this application 
		module enables the representation of products proposed to market with a great number of variants and 
		whose composition is characterized due to the selection among a set of different product features. 
		</p>
		<example>
		Examples of such products are the products developed by the furniture industry, the automotive industry 
		and the commercial airplane industry.
		</example>
		<p>
		This application module specifies the data types and their constraints. It specifies the conformance class 1 
		of ISO 10303-236.
		</p>
		<p>
		A catalogue contains a list of references of different commercial products that are proposed to customers or 
		to distributors. A catalogue provides a commercial view of the products of a supplier or manufacturer but it does 
		not represent the design information of the commercial products.
		</p>
		<p>
		It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.
		</p>
		<p>
		The core of the product model is catalogue information. This information is connected to other parts in order to 
		define the geometry of the products and to select a set of product features.
		</p>
		<p> 
		This application module provides the definition for the main information data of a catalogue, such as the definition 
		of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a product that the customer can 
		chose in order to select one product from another). The structure of the product (the product itself or the 
		decomposition of the product in its components), the effectivity of the catalogue itself or its products, the effectivity 
		of the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) that gives additional information about the 
		product such as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a classification of the products in order they 
		could be found easily in a catalogue depending on different search criteria; the properties of the product (not 
		selectable by the user). It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalogue specification in the 
		<module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO/TS 10303-1103</module_ref> (Product class). It also adds to the 
		catalog data information the capability of including the geometry of the products. It includes application modules for
		 the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the 
		 shape of product components, through subtypes of the generic type 
		 <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric 
		 Model</express_ref>.
		 </p>
		<p>
		In particular, this application module enables the representation of products proposed to market with a great number 
		of variants and whose composition is characterized with expressions of operands selected in a set of product features.
