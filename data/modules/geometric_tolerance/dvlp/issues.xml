No way to specify modifiers other than Tolerance condition such as FREE STATE, UNEQUALLY DISPOSED, TANGENT.  Method must allow for multiple conditions.
</description>

<comment
   by="Tom Hendrix"
   date="03-11-02">
<description>
Tangent can be modeled by assigning the tolerance to a derived_shape_aspect. Unequally disposed can be modeled by a tolerance zone with one explicit boundary that is an Offset_shape_element that is offset from the toleranced feature by the amount of the offset.  However, part 47 should have a SEDS to fix this by for example make an extensible enumeration.  Or else some sort of assignment.

<description>
SC 4 shall not redefine concepts on geometrical product specification and tolerancing since they are already defined in ISO TC 213. 
Two  examples:- Subclause 4.3.7 gives the definition of a "datum" which is different from the one of ISO 5459:1981 and also different from the one of  ISO/DIS 5459-1:2002.-  
Subclause 4.3.4 defines a "compound_datum" which seems to correspond to a "common datum" in ISO 5459:1981 and ISO/DIS 5459-1:2002. 
A note has been added "A compound datum is in some tolerancing standards called a multiple datum feature or a common datum".	
SC 4 and ISO/TC 213 should work together to identify the discrepancies.

BAE SYSTEMS has its own internal standards on tolerances, generally based on external standards such as BS8888. The propsed module will not be interpreted consistently unless it references an appropriate standard for Geometric Tolerancing. Observations marked MjT (Major Technical) may in fact be issues in the context of a particular tolerancing standard. It is therfore recommended that this module be REJECTED.

Agree this is needed. Not sure where is best place to put it.

datum_representation_select
The targets of the select include Shape_element and Derived_shape_element, which is a subtype of Shape_element. If there is a specific reason for doing this, then it should be mentioned in the definition otherwise it would be sufficient to only reference Shape_element and to add a note to the effect that this includes Derived_shape_element as a subtype

The definitions of tolerance are not given any context in which they can be uniquely interpeted. This is required. This should either be done by a reference (preferably to an ISO statndard) or by a full explanation with supporting examples)

Agree. See comment on UK19.  Propose to provide a reference because of large user requirement for standards other than ISO, for example BAE Systems  does not use ISO 1101. 
Standard will be specified in a higher module.

The cardinality of many of the reference_datum attributes is a set[1:2] (or [0:3]). Please check that this is a set of 1 or 2 elements (or 0, 1, 2, or 3), rather than an array, and that the order in which the datums are used is irrelevant. The descriptions are confusing, as they often refer to &quot; the datum system that defines...&quot;  where in fact the cardinality does not specify a single datum.

Accept, mostly. Replaced with &#x22;the set of datums that defines &#x22;.  Added notes to explain the cases of 0 to 3 cardinality. The case of 0 to 2 is based on the AIC 519 interpretation of ISO 1101 that certain tolerances may not have 3 datums. The precedence of datums is established through their attribute

Circular_runout_tolerance:angle
The reference to the "datum axis" implies either that an axis is defined explicitly for the datum (which is not done) or that the type of datum used must have a unique axis (which requires a Where rule). This is also confusing, as two datums may be used.

Reject. Required for AP214 compatibility. Agree that datum is a generic term. However, in GDT Datum is a reserved word. Other uses of datum are more informal.

AP 224 explicitly references 5459 in its use of datum in clause 3, and AP 214 references it as a note in 4.2.123 (Datum). 5459 should therefore be referenced as the source of the definition in clause 3.

Need to handle patterns of complicated shapes that may have different kinds of tolerances applied to different portions.
Example: A rectangular hole with rounded corners. 
Each pair of sides can be considered a slot that is a feature of size. 
Each corner can have radial dimension applied as a 4 X 0.5  
Each corner can have a form tolerance, or can have a separate for each hole . Or, an all around profile tolerance can be applied, etc.  The hole can be repeated as a pattern for composite position tolerancing.</description>
