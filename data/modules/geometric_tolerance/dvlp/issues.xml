No way to specify modifiers other than Tolerance condition such as FREE STATE, UNEQUALLY DISPOSED, TANGENT.  Method must allow for multiple conditions.
</description>

<comment
   by="Tom Hendrix"
   date="03-11-02">
<description>
Tangent can be modeled by assigning the tolerance to a derived_shape_aspect. Unequally disposed can be modeled by a tolerance zone with one explicit boundary that is an Offset_shape_element that is offset from the toleranced feature by the amount of the offset.  However, part 47 should have a SEDS to fix this by for example make an extensible enumeration.

<description>
SC 4 shall not redefine concepts on geometrical product specification and tolerancing since they are already defined in ISO TC 213. 
Two  examples:- Subclause 4.3.7 gives the definition of a "datum" which is different from the one of ISO 5459:1981 and also different from the one of  ISO/DIS 5459-1:2002.-  
Subclause 4.3.4 defines a "compound_datum" which seems to correspond to a "common datum" in ISO 5459:1981 and ISO/DIS 5459-1:2002. 
A note has been added "A compound datum is in some tolerancing standards called a multiple datum feature or a common datum".	
SC 4 and ISO/TC 213 should work together to identify the discrepancies.

It is not clear how to  specify what  standard is to be used to interpret the instances or dimensions and tolerances found in a schema instance (NOTE this may belong in AP203e2 instead of a module)	
Create an arm entity GDT_specification, that is a specialization of Document, and assign it to Product_view_defintion, or Item_shape, Or Document in the  usage guide how this is to be done with existing constructs.

Does not specify how to do bi-directional tolerancing.  
Feature location dimension system is either
 rectangular or polar. Suggest	model with two geometric tolerances, which are each related to separate location dimensions, using a  part 47 shape dimension_related_tolerance_zone_element 
Measurement path must be specified for the dimensions.  Perhaps additionally, a geometric_tolerance_relationship could be used between the geometric tolerances
Either rectangular or polar coordinates must be supported.

BAE SYSTEMS has its own internal standards on tolerances, generally based on external standards such as BS8888. The propsed module will not be interpreted consistently unless it references an appropriate standard for Geometric Tolerancing. Observations marked MjT (Major Technical) may in fact be issues in the context of a particular tolerancing standard. It is therfore recommended that this module be REJECTED.

Agree this is needed. Not sure where is best place to put it. Probably  high up the USE FROM tree, because potentially an external standard  could apply to almost anything in an AP203e32 schema instance. I am thinking of annotations particularly which are not there but may come.</p> <p> The only STEP standard that addresses this is  AP210 which has an ARM entity mapped in part: </p>

The scope is rather terse, particularly with respect to datum systems. It should be made clear if these are modelled only in respect of tolerances. The term "datum" is also uses to mean the origin of a local co-ordinate space

The cardinality of many of the reference_datum attributes is a set[1:2] (or [0:3]). Please check that this is a set of 1 or 2 elements (or 0, 1, 2, or 3), rather than an array, and that the order in which the datums are used is irrelevant. The descriptions are confusing, as they often refer to "the datum system that defines..." where in fact the cardinality does not specify a single datum.

Circular_runout_tolerance:angle
The reference to the "datum axis" implies either that an axis is defined explicitly for the datum (which is not done) or that the type of datum used must have a unique axis (which requires a Where rule). This is also confusing, as two datums may be used.

Geometric_tolerance:WR2
If tolerance_value is to be a length measure, then how are angular_tolerances to be measured?

Geometric_tolerance tolerance_value
The attribute implicitly references an external standard, but it is not explained how this standard should be referenced (e.g. by assigning a document_element).

As there is more than one example, the examples should be numbered

Placed_target
The definition specifies that parameters are used, but the entity does not supply the parameters nor is any indication given showing where the parameters and their values are to be found.

Added words to Placed_target description that it is one of its suptypes. Added words to parameter_references to say that the params are documented in the subtype.

Projection
The entity does not specify in which direction the project is made.

The text specifies that the projection is external to the part. Clarified that the projection was from the shape_element projection_end .  Added a note that the representation for one or both of the Shape_elements that define the tolerance zone may be included if  necessary .

Reference_plane
This entity has no attributes, nor is it a subtype. As it stands, it is entirely useless. It appears on sheet 2 of the EXPRESS-G but in several places is referenced as being on sheet 1.

Entity is harmonized with AP214 and AP224.  Numbering is put in by express-g tool. Will need to investigate how best to modify.

Warning Attr1 Geometric_tolerance_arm.Target_circle.diameter. Circular definition. The attribute description should not start with the name of the attribute
     Phrase:the diameter of the datum target.

Reject. This is a mathematical definition for an attribute of the same name.

Need to handle patterns of complicated shapes that may have different kinds of tolerances applied to different portions.
Example: A rectangular hole with rounded corners. 
Each pair of sides can be considered a slot that is a feature of size. 
Each corner can have radial dimension applied as a 4 X 0.5  
Each corner can have a form tolerance, or can have a separate for each hole . Or, an all around profile tolerance can be applied. Etc.  The hole can be repeated as a pattern for composite position tolerancing.   </description>
