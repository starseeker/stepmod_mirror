<description>
BAE SYSTEMS has its own internal standards on tolerances, generally based on external standards such as BS8888. The propsed module will not be interpreted consistently unless it references an appropriate standard for Geometric Tolerancing. Observations marked MjT (Major Technical) may in fact be issues in the context of a particular tolerancing standard. It is therfore recommended that this module be REJECTED.

<description>
The scope is rather terse, particularly with respect to datum systems. It should be made clear if these are modelled only in respect of tolerances. The term "datum" is also uses to mean the origin of a local co-ordinate space

datum_representation_select
The targets of the select include Shape_element and Derived_shape_element, which is a subtype of Shape_element. If there is a specific reason for doing this, then it should be mentioned in the definition otherwise it would be sufficient to only reference Shape_element and to add a note to the effect that this includes Derived_shape_element as a subtype.

General
The definitions of tolerance are not given any context in which they can be uniquely interpeted. This is required. This should either be done by a reference (preferably to an ISO statndard) or by a full explanation with supporting examples.</description>

ARM:General

Many of the definitions use the phrase "sepecifies a requirement to control", which is confusing and should be made clear.

<description>
The cardinality of many of the reference_datum attributes is a set[1:2] (or [0:3]). Please check that this is a set of 1 or 2 elements (or 0, 1, 2, or 3), rather than an array, and that the order in which the datums are used is irrelevant. The descriptions are confusing, as they often refer to "the datum system that defines..." where in fact the cardinality does not specify a single datum

The type of tolerance discussed may put a restriction on the subtype of datum which the tolerance is defined against.

:Circular_runout_tolerance:angle
The reference to the "datum axis" implies either that an axis is defined explicitly for the datum (which is not done) or that the type of datum used must have a unique axis (which requires a Where rule). This is also confusing, as two datums may be used

Datum
This definition precludes the use of the term datum in any other context. The entity should be renamed Tolerance_datum, with similar renaming applying to the other entities using the word "datum".
