      <description>
        A Geometrically_based_surface_shape_representation describes the
shape or portions of the shape of a product using a surface model without
topology. It is a shape_representation consisting of geometric
sets. Points, curves, and surfaces may be contained in a geometric_set
provided they are of the same dimensionality. A
geometrically_bounded_surface_shape_representation shall include at least
one surface. The geometric entities that are exclusively used to support
the definition of other geometric entities shall not themselves exist in
the sets of elements of a geometric_set. All geometric entities shall be of
dimensionality three except for two-dimensional geometry that is used for
the purpose of defining pcurves. The use of one-dimensional
cartesian_points is excluded. 
        <p>
All unbounded curves and surfaces shall be explicitly trimmed. The
boundaries of curves shall be defined either by points on curves and
explicit associations between these points and curves, or by parameter
values. The boundaries of surfaces shall be defined either by curves on
surfaces and explicit associations between these curves and surfaces, or by
parameter values. 
        </p>
        <p>
The items of a geometrically_bounded_surface_shape_representation may also
be of type mapped_item, or axis2_placement_3d. These are used to assemble
one or several geometrically_bounded_surface_shape_representations into one
other geometrically_bounded_surface_shape_representation.

      <where label="IP1">
        <description>
          The items in a geometrically_bounded_surface_shape_representation
          shall be geometric_sets, mapped_items, or axis2_placement_3ds. 

          <note>
            Axis2_placement_3d is a valid mapped_item.mapping_target. To
include an other representation into the list of items of a
geometrically_bounded_surface_shape_representation (see IP3 for valid
mapped_items), the mapped_item.mapping_source.mapping origin may be any
entity that is geometrically founded in the
geometric_representation_context of the mapped_representation. If this
entity is an axis2_placement_3d, the operator that maps the
mapped_representation into the
geometrically_bounded_surface_shape_representation corresponds to a
transformation matrix with only translation and rotation enabled. If a
cartesian_transformation_operator_3d is used as mapping_origin, scaling and
mirroring are possible.
