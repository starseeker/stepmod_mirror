   <ext_description linkend="Geometrically_bounded_wireframe_arm.Geometrically_bounded_wireframe_shape_representation">
A geometrically_bounded_wireframe_shape_representation is a
shape_representation that represents the shape, or portions of the shape,
of a product by wireframe geometry without topology. These representations
are formed by the use of points and curves only. All unbounded curves shall
be explicitly trimmed unless they are closed. The boundaries of the curves
shall be defined explicitly by points on the curves and explicit
associations between the points and the curves that they bound or by
parameter values. Each geometric_set in a
geometrically_bounded_wireframe_shape_representation shall contain only
those entities that define the physical object that is being represented by
a particular instance of the
geometrically_bounded_wireframe_shape_representation. The geometric
entities that are used to support the definition of another geometric
entity shall not exist themselves in the elements set of a geometric_set. 

        <note>
          An application protocol that uses this application module may
ensure that the shape_representation entity is instantiated as an
geometrically_bounded_wireframe_shape_representation.
        </note>

        
      <example>
     A circular arc is to be used to define the corner radius on a part
that is being represented using a
geometrically_bounded_wireframe_shape_representation. The representation of
the arc is a trimmed_curve whose basis_curve is a circle.
