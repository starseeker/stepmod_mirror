       A <b>Hybrid_breakdown</b> is a type of 
     <express_ref linkend="product_breakdown:arm:Product_breakdown_arm.Breakdown"/>
     that identifies a non-specific partitioning of a product into a set of related
     elements so as to form explicit, parent-child views that comprise the
     elements. 

   <p>
     The parent-child view is represented by 
     <express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element_usage"/>
     instances relating the elements in the hybrid breakdown which are
     represented by types of 
     <express_ref linkend="product_breakdown:arm:Product_breakdown_arm.Breakdown_element"/>s.
   </p>
   <example>
     A product breakdown in which a 'climate control' function has a decomposition that comprises a 'heating function' 
     and a 'cooling function'  and in which the 'heating function' has a decomposition that comprises a 'heating element' 
     and a 'heat distribution system' would be an example of a 'hybrid breakdown'.
   </example>
