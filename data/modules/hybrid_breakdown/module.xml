	<!-- Introduction -->
	<!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
	<purpose>
		<p>
			This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of various hybrid breakdowns of products. A hybrid 					breakdown is a non-specific partitioning of a product into a set of related elements to support engineering, analysis and other activities that may 
			be performed in relation to the product. These breakdowns are explicit, parent-child views that comprise the hybrid elements.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hybrid breakdown view is complementary to the assembly structure and bill of materials views that are the primary focus for manufacturing 
			(realization) of a product (see <module_ref linkend="part_definition_relationship:introduction"> Part definition relationship</module_ref>). 
			Hybrid breakdowns may be of designs or realized individual systems. For any product, more than one hybrid breakdown may exist to 
			support various different engineering activities.
		</p>
		<example>
			?????????.
		</example>
		<p>
			A 
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_breakdown"/> 
			is also a 
			<express_ref linkend="product_breakdown:arm:Product_breakdown_arm.Breakdown"/> 
			and a 
			<express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> and, thus, has identification and may have versions 
			(<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_breakdown_version"/>).
		</p>
		<p>
			Each version of a Hybrid_breakdown (
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_breakdown_version"/>
			) is related to the product that is the subject of the breakdown through 
			<express_ref linkend="product_breakdown:arm:Product_breakdown_arm.Breakdown_of"/>
			.
		</p>
		<p>
			The constituent components of a hybrid breakdown are represented by 
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element"/> 
			objects.
		</p>
		<p>
			A 
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element"/> 
			may appear in one or more breakdowns and is a 
			<express_ref linkend="product_breakdown:arm:Product_breakdown_arm.Breakdown"/> 
			and a 
			<express_ref linkend="product_identification:arm:Product_identification_arm.Product"/> 
			with identification, versions (
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element_version"/>
			) and views (
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element_definition"/>
			) of those versions.
		</p>
		<p>
			A 
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element_usage"/> 
			identifies the parent-child relationship between a pair of 
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element"/> 
			objects in the context of the relevant breakdown.  The complete breakdown hierarchy comprises a tree of 
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element_usage"/> 
			objects.
		</p>
		<p>
			This part of ISO 10303 also supports the requirement to identify the product or relationship between products that is the realization of a 
			<express_ref linkend="hybrid_breakdown:arm:Hybrid_breakdown_arm.Hybrid_element"/>
			.  A 
			<express_ref linkend="product_breakdown:arm:Product_breakdown_arm.Breakdown_element_realization"/> 
			object provides this identification.
