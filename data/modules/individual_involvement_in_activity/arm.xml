<p>An <b> Individual involvement in activity</b> specifies that a thing is involved in an individual
activity.</p>
<p>An individual is involved in an activity if a segment in the life of the
individual is part of the activity. Hence:</p>
<ul>
<li>an individual product is involved in an activity if it is created, used or
changed by the activity;</li>
<li>an individual document is involved in an activity if it is created,
modified or read by the activity;</li>
<li>an individual organization is involved in an activity if it plays a role in
the activity;</li>
<li>an individual person is involved in an activity if he or she plays a role
in the activity.</li>
</ul>
<example><p>The involvment of John Doe, who is a stress engineer
at Joe Bloggs and Co. in the stress analysis of part XYZ_123 carried out on
2001-05-02 is an <b>individual_involvement_in_activity</b>.</p>
<p>This individual involvement is classified as a member of the
<b>class_of_involvement_in_activity</b> 'stress analysis performer'.</p>
</example>
<p>A <b>class</b> can also be involved in
an <b>individual_activity</b>. In this case it is the class itself and not the
members of the class that play a role.</p>
<note>This entity is identical to <b>involvment</b> in ISO
15926-2.</note>
