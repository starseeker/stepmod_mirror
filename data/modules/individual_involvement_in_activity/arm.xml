<p>An <b> Individual involvement in activity</b> specifies that a thing is involved in an individual
activity.</p>
<p>An individual is involved in an activity if a segment in the life of the
individual is part of the activity. Hence:</p>
<ul>
<li>an individual product is involved in an activity if it is created, used or
changed by the activity;</li>
<li>an individual document is involved in an activity if it is created,
modified or read by the activity;</li>
<li>an individual organization is involved in an activity if it plays a role in
the activity;</li>
<li>an individual person is involved in an activity if he or she plays a role
in the activity.</li>
</ul>
<example><p>The involvment of John Doe, who is a stress engineer
at Joe Bloggs and Co. in the stress analysis of part XYZ_123 carried out on
2001-05-02 is an <b>individual_involvement_in_activity</b>.</p>
<p>This individual involvement is classified as a member of the
<express_ref linkend="class_of_involvement_in_activity:arm:Class_of_involvement_in_activity_arm.Class_of_involvement_in_activity">Class_of_involvement_in_activity</express_ref> 'stress analysis performer'.</p>
</example>
<p>A <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class">Class</express_ref> can also be involved in
an <express_ref linkend="individual_activity:arm:Individual_activity_arm.Individual_activity">Individual_activity</express_ref>. In this case it is the class itself and not the
members of the class that play a role.</p>
<note>This entity is similar to the entity <b>participation</b> in ISO
15926-2. However, in ISO 15926-2 <b>participation</b> is a relationship with a
temporal part of a whole life individual, whereas in this part of ISO 10303
<b>individual_involvement_in_activity</b> is a relationship with a
whole life individual.</note>
