<P>An <B> Individual involvement in activity</B> specifies that a thing is involved in an individual
activity.</P>
<P>An individual is involved in an activity if a segment in the life of the
individual is part of the activity. Hence:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an individual product is involved in an activity if it is created, used or
changed by the activity;</LI>
<LI>an individual document is involved in an activity if it is created,
modified or read by the activity;</LI>
<LI>an individual organization is involved in an activity if it plays a role in
the activity;</LI>
<LI>an individual person is involved in an activity if he or she plays a role
in the activity.</LI>
</UL>
<example><P>The involvment of John Doe, who is a stress engineer
at Joe Bloggs and Co. in the stress analysis of part XYZ_123 carried out on
2001-05-02 is an <B>individual_involvement_in_activity</B>.</P>
<P>This individual involvement is classified as a member of the
<B>class_of_involvement_in_activity</B> 'stress analysis performer'.</P>
</example>
<P>A <b>class</b> can also be involved in
an <B>individual_activity</B>. In this case it is the class itself and not the
members of the class that play a role.</P>
