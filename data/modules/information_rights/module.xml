 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of rights concerning the access and use of information. That is, it records the right 
     of a person or organisation to use information in a certain way, or for a certain purpose. These rights
     include ownership of copyright, ownership of intellectual propoerty or a grant to use information, perhaps restricted
     to a particular contract. Rights over personal data are not considered.
   </p>
   <p>
	The recording of usage rights is important in collaborative work, particularly where
	a shared data environment is used. Such an environment may contain data from several competing
	companies, none of whom may see the other's data, although all such data may be visible to a co-ordinating contractor.
	
   </p>
   <p>
	The module allows the recording of a particular right, the historical act of granting that right to
	an organisation, perhaps under a particular contract, and the assignment of that right to particular
	data items. The granting of the right can be approved in general, or only for specific items of data. The latter would be
	used where special permission is needed for a particular data item.
	Under this module, rights cannot be granted to a general class of item, and this would need an extension
	to the current module. The module supports both the recording of the currently available rights and the history of granting rights.
   </p>
   <p>
	Rights are always defined within a legal framework. It is incumbent on users of this model to
	ensure that the legal framework is in place under which the rights are interpreted, and to
	ensure that the use and interpretation of rights are well defined.
   </p>
