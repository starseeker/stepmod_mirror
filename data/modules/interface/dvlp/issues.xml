 <p>
a) Electrical connections between components is the domain of AP210 and AP212.
b) This module mixes up two different concepts, the one on usage_view and design_view (black/white box) and the concept of connectors and connections. It is essential to separate these concepts.

 </p>
 <p>
a) Harmonize the concept of a connector and connections with AP210 and AP212
b) Rename this module to "Connector"
c) create a new module on usage- and design_view to clearly separate the "interface" concept from the internal "design" concept. See AP210 for details.</p>

     ISSUE: Interface Connectors
   </p>
   <p>
     In SysML you don't have to name every connector but in the Interface
     modules you do. So, I end up creating dummy Interface_connector,
     Interface_connector_version and Interface_connector_definition instances
     for each connector with names like "Anonymous Connector 1 on R1 in Low-pass
     filter" for the Interface connector and appending "Version 1" and then
     "Version 1 Definition 1" for the version and definition. While this is
     tedious I can accept that STEP wants to make explicit what is implicit in
     the SysML diagram. Then you add instances of Connector_on to relate the
     Interface_connector_definition to the item it's attached to which is either
     a Product_view_definition or a View_definition_relationship and while
     tedious, this also works.
   </p>
   <p>
     However, when the connector has a name in SysML, like "Input on
     Low-pass filter" there's a problem. You create the Interface_connector,
     Interface_connector_version and Interface_connector_definition and say is
     is on the Product_view_definintion named "Low-pass filter Version 1
     Definition 1". The problem arises when "Low-pass filter Version 1
     Definition 1" is used as a component "F1" in a higher level assembly like
     Filter Circuit. It turns out that you cannot reuse the definition "Input on
     Low-pass filter" wrt "F1" when you are making a Interface_connection
     instance... you can only do that between
     Interface_connector_definitions. The only workaround seems to be to have to
     create "duplicate" instances of Interface_connector,
     Interface_connector_version and Interface_connector_definition for each use
     of a named Interface_connector. This is a problem because "Input on
     Low-pass filter Version 1 Definition 1" and "Input on F1 Low-pass filter in
     Filter Circuit Version 1 Definition 1" are really the same connector
     definition.
   </p>
   <p>
     On the above diagram it boils down to the fact that when connecting
     "S1" and "Input" on "F1" in "Filter Circuit", I am forced to treat "Input"
     on "F1" in "Filter Circuit" as completely unrelated to the definition of
     "Input" on "Low-pass filter" when they are clearly the same definition
     (i.e. they would have the same properties, etc.).
   </p>
   <p>
     PROPOSED SOLUTION:
   </p>
   <p>
     The only solution I can come up with is to allow Interface_connection to
     refer to Connector_on as well as Interface_connector_definition given the
     current structure but that doesn't make sense as Interface_connection is a
     kind of View_definition_relationship. So, a rethink might be more in
     order. Perhaps Interface_connection is not a kind of
     View_definition_relationship?

     ISSUE: Connector_on is not Next_assembly_usage 
   </p>
   <p>
     In SysML a Port (i.e. Interface_connector in STEP) is a kind of Part
     (i.e. Product in STEP). Therefore, Ports appear as normal Parts in the
     assembly structure. In AP239, it seems that the idea of an
     Interface_connector being part of an assembly requires two sets of
     relationships, first the Next_assembly_usage is needed to make the it part
     of the assembly and then Connector_on is needed to link the definition of
     the connector to the definition of the assembly. The modules do not provide
     clear guidance as to whether this duplication is expected or whether there
     is an error in the way Connector_on works. 
   </p>
   <p>
     PROPOSED SOLUTION:
   </p>
   <p>
     Determine if Connector_on makes something part of an "assembly" and update
     the documentation or the model or both as appropriate.
   </p>

   <p>ISSUE: Anonymous Ports</p>
   <p>
     In SysML, not all Ports (i.e STEP connectors) are required to be
     defined. In the example diagram, Resistor has two "anonymous"
     Ports. However, in STEP these Ports are required to be created as
     Interface_connector_defintion (and Interface_connector_version and
     Interface_connector). As there is no name in the SysML diagram they are
     "anonymous". For the mapping we did, we generated names such as "Anonymous
     connector 1 on Version 1 of Definition 1 ... ".   This creation of explicit
     instances is caused by the fact that STEP only allows Interface_connection
     between two Interface_connector_definition instances.
   </p>

   <p>PROPOSED SOLUTION:</p>
   <p>
     Do not require explicit instantiation of unmodeled ports. It seems
     like something such as allowing Interface_connection between
     Interface_connector_definition and Next_assembly_usage might work. 
   </p>
