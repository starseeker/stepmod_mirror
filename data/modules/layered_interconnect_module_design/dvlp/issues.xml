Agree.  The rule shall exist.
The rule states that the material that makes up the passage shall be conductive.
<p> 
WR3: SIZEOF ( QUERY ( mi &lt;* USEDIN ( SELF , 'GENERIC_MATERIAL_ASPECTS_ARM.' + 'MATERIAL_IDENTIFICATION.' + 'ITEMS' ) | ( 'CONDUCTIVITY_MATERIAL_ASPECTS.' + 'MATERIAL_IDENTIFICATION_WITH_CONDUCTIVITY_CLASSIFICATION' IN TYPEOF ( mi ) ) ) = 1 ) ;

<p>The above expres is not correct. It is only included here to capture it.</p>

Agree.  The rule shall exist.
The rule states that there shall be exactly one material assigned to the default_via_definition.  It inherits the property from the supertype that it shall be classified as conductive so this rule doesn't need to say that.
<p> 
It may be useful to use a DERIVEd attribute deposition_material here.

Why did this WR was removed: All Layer_connection_points specified shall be on the same Design_layer_stratum?

where rule rewritten.  now states that if laminate_component participates in
a padstack occurrence then the assembly_component_relationship shall be the
Padstack_occurrence_sub_assembly_relationship that relates it to the padstack_occurrence.
xml and descriptions need to be updated.

Agree.  The rule shall exist.
The rule states that there may be no more than one material assigned to the Passage_technology and that if a material is assigned, then that material shall have a conductivity classification

It may be useful to use a DERIVEd attribute deposition_material here.

<p>material attribute migrated to Passage_technology so following proposed rules are needed:</p>
<p>WR2: Each passage that is plated shall have deposition_material provided.</p>
<p>WR3: Each passage that has maximum_as_finished_deposition_thickness provided shall have deposition_material provided.</p>
<p>WR4: Each passage that has minimum_as_finished_deposition_thickness provided shall have deposition_material provided.</p>
<p>WR5: If plated_passage has a value of TRUE Passage_technology shall reference Material_conductivity_classification that equals "conductive".</p>
