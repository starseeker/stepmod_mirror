Agree.  The rule shall exist.
The rule states that there shall be exactly one material assigned to the default_via_definition.  It inherits the property from the supertype that it shall be classified as conductive so this rule doesn't need to say that.

It may be useful to use a DERIVEd attribute deposition_material here.

  Conductive_interconnect_element_with_pre_defined_transitions

<p>proposed solution</p>
padstack_occurrence_sub_assembly_relationship should be a subtype of Next_assembly_usage which is a subtype of Assembly_component_relationship.
footprint_occurrence_sub_assembly_relationship should be a subtype of Next_assembly_usage which is a subtype of Assembly_component_relationship.

Laminate_component.padstack_occurrence_assembly needs to be revised to be derived from Assembly_component.occurrence_contexts : SET[1:?] OF Assembly_component_relationship FOR related_view;
Laminate_component.footprint_occurence_assembly needs to be revised.
<p>results proposed for attributes:</p>
DERIVE
Laminate_component.padstack_occurrence_assembly : Padstack_occurrence_sub_assembly_relationship := SELF\Assembly_component.occurrence_contexts[1];

<description>
better solution is to not have footprint_occurrence and padstack_occurrence be subtypes of Assembly_group_component at all.
That would eliminate these rules.  This proposal would require adding terminals to Footprint_occurrence and Padstack_occurrence directly rather than relying
on the indirect terminals of the Laminate_components they are composed of.
See separate issues logged against Footprint_occurrence and Padstack_occurrence.

Options:

2-remove Footprint_occurrence from being a subtype of Assembly_group_component; Make it just a subtype of Assembly_component.
Proposal:
Do the second, and replace explicit structure to Laminate_component with explicit structure to new ao Footprint_occurrence_terminal,
adding to possibility to have this new terminal also in fabricated_feature_select so that it
can be referenced by Fabrication_joint so that correct stratum and stratum_feature can
