      <p>
         ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
         federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of
         preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
         technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for
         which a technical committee has been established has the right to be
         represented on that committee. International organizations,
         governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take
         part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International
         Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical
         standardization. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in
         the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The main task of technical committees is to prepare International
         Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical
         committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as
         an International Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the member
         bodies casting a vote.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         In other circumstances, particularly when there is an urgent market
         requirement for such documents, a technical committee may decide to
         publish other types of normative document: 
         
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            an ISO Publicly Available Specification (ISO/PAS) represents an
            agreement between technical experts in an ISO working group and  is
            accepted for publication if it is approved by more than 50% 
            of the members of the parent committee casting a vote;
            
         </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>
            an ISO Technical Specification (ISO/TS) represents an agreement between
            the members of a technical committee and is accepted for
            publication if it is approved by 2/3 of the members of the committee
            casting a vote. 
            
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         An ISO/PAS or ISO/TS is reviewed every three years with a view to
         deciding whether it can be transformed into an International Standard.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this
         part of ISO 10303 may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be
         held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
         
      </p>
      <p>ISO/TS 10303-xxxx
         was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 184, 
         <i>Industrial automation systems and integration,</i>
         Subcommittee SC4, <i>Industrial data.</i></p>
      <p>
         This International Standard is organized as a series of parts, each
         published separately. The structure of this International Standard is
         described in ISO 10303-1
         <sup><a href="#10303-1">1</a>)
            </sup>.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Each part of this International Standard is a
         member of one of the following series: description methods, implementation
         methods, conformance testing methodology and framework, integrated generic
         resources, integrated application resources, application protocols,
         abstract test suites, application interpreted constructs, and application
         modules. This part is a member of the application modules series. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         A complete list of parts of ISO 10303 is available from the Internet:
