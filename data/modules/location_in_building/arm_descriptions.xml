A <b>Component_position_in_building</b> is the specification of the placement of an item, which is defined in its own coordinate space, in the coordinate space of a reference item. 
<p>Placement is specified as the transformation, applied to a representation of the shape of the placed item, that transforms the coordinates of the geometric entities of that representation 
into coordinates expressed in the coordinate system of a representation of the shape of the reference item.</p>
