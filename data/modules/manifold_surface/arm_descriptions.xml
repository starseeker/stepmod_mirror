   <ext_description linkend="Manifold_surface_arm.Manifold_surface_shape_representation">
A <b>Manifold_surface_shape_representation</b> is a type of <b>Geometric_model</b> that consists of one or many 
shell_based surface models. 
<p>Each shell_based surface model is built up of open shells which are connected sets of faces. </p>
 
<note>This entity is incompletely modelled in the ARM. Complete specification 
can be obtained in the definition of the corresponding MIM entity.
