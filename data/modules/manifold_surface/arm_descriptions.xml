   <ext_description linkend="Manifold_surface_arm.Manifold_surface_shape_representation">
A <b>Manifold_surface_shape_representation</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model"/>

 that consists of one or many 
shell-based surface models. 
<p>Each shell-based surface model is built up of open shells which are connected sets of faces. </p>
 
<note number="1">This entity is incompletely modeled in the ARM. Complete specification 
can be obtained in the definition of the corresponding MIM entity.
</note>
<note number="2">Although this only appears in the MIM schema, the faces included in shell-based surface models are <express_ref linkend="topologically_bounded_surface:arm:Topologically_bounded_surface_arm.Advanced_face"/>.
