   <ext_description linkend="Manifold_surface_arm.Manifold_surface_shape_representation">
A <b>Manifold_surface_shape_representation</b> is a type of <b>Geometric_model</b> that consists of one or many 
shell-based surface models. 
<p>Each shell-based surface model is built up of open shells which are connected sets of faces. </p>
 
<note number="1">This entity is incompletely modelled in the ARM. Complete specification 
can be obtained in the definition of the corresponding MIM entity.
</note>
<note number="2">Although this only appears in the MIM schema, the faces included in shell-based surface models are advanced_faces, as defined in module <b>topologically_bounded_surface</b>.
