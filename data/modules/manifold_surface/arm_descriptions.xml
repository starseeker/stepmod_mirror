   <ext_description linkend="Manifold_surface_arm.Manifold_surface_shape_representation">
A manifold_surface_shape_representation is a shape_representation that consists of one or many shell_based_surface models. Each shell_based_surface_model is built up of open_shells which are sets of faces. Connected_face_set, which is the supertype of open_shell and closed_shell, shall not be instantiated. Faces use edges and vertexs; all of these shall reference geometric entities such as points, curves, and surfaces. The link between topology and geometric entities such as points, curves, and surfaces. The link between topology and geometry may be established by either using face_surface or advanced_face as defined in ISO 10303-511. The two options differ both in the selection of valid point, curve, and surface subtypes and in constraints on references to underlying geometry. 

        <note> The representation of face surfaces as advanced faces is recommended for manifold surface models that are intended to be used together with boundary representation solid models; the integration of such a manifold surface model into, for example, an advanced boundary representation model, which is defined in ISO 10303-514, will be easier.
      </note>
      
      <p>
All geometric entities shall be of dimensionality three except for two-dimensional geometry that is used for the purpose of defining pcurves. The use of one-dimensional cartesian points is excluded.
      </p>
      
      <p>
All unbounded geometry shall be trimmed by using topological constructs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
The items of a manifold surface shape representation may also be of type mapped-item, or axis2 placement 3d. These are used to assemble one or several manifold surface shape representations into one other manifold surface - shape representation.
