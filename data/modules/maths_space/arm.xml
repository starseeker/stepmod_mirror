<p>A <b>Maths_space</b> is a set of mathematical values.</p>
<note>The details of the attributes of <b>Maths_space</b> are described in ISO 10303-50, and are not repeated here.</note>
<p>The following subtypes of <b>Maths_space</b> are within the scope of this part of ISO 10303:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Elementary_maths_space</b>:</dt>
<dd><p>This is a <b>Maths_space</b> that is one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>all real values;</li>
<li>all integer values;</li>
<li>all Boolean values;</li>
<li>the complex values.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>Finite_space</b>:</dt>
<dd><p>This is a <b>Maths_space</b> that is an finite set of mathematical values and that has these values explicitly stated.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Integer_interval</b>:</dt>
<dd><p>This is a <b>Maths_space</b> that is an integer interval, bounded above, bounded below, or bounded both above and below.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Real_interval</b>:</dt>
<dd><p>This is a <b>Maths_space</b> that is an real interval, bounded above, bounded below, or bounded both above and below.  Each bound can be either open or closed.</p></dd>
<dt><b>Tuple_space</b>:</dt>
<dd><p>This is a <b>Maths_space</b> that has tuples as members.  A <b>Tuple_space</b> can be defined as a Cartesian product of other mathematical spaces.  Two approaches for defining the factors of the Cartesian product are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the factors are listed;</p>
<example>The space of (integer, real) pairs is the Cartesian product of the spaces 'integer' and 'real'.</example></li>
<li><p>the space is specified with an exponent.</p>
<example>The space of real triples (i.e. R<sup>3</sup>) is defined by the space 'real' and the exponent 3.</example></li>
</ul></dd>
