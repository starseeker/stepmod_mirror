         is a type of
        <express_ref linkend="mesh_connectivity:arm:Mesh_connectivity_arm.Mesh_connectivity" />that contains conectivity information for generalized mesh interfaces. Its purpose is to describe mismatched-abutting and overset interfaces for both structured and unstructured meshes, and can also be used for 1-to-1 abutting interfaces.
<p>
For abutting interfaces, also referred to as patched or mismatched, an interface patch is the subrange of the face of a mesh that touches one and only one other mesh. This structure identifies the subrange of indices (or array of indices) that make up the interface and gives their image in the adjacent (donor) mesh. It also identifies the adjacent mesh. If a given face of a mesh touches several (say N) adjacent meshes, then N different instances of mismatched - mesh connection are needed to describe all the interfaces. For a single abutting interface, two instances of mismatched mesh connection are needed - one for each adjacent mesh. 
</p>
<p>
For overset interfaces, this structure identifies the fringe points of a given mesh that lie in one and only one other mesh. If the fringe points of a mesh lie in several (say N) overlapping meshes, then N different instances of mismatched mesh connection are needed to describe the overlaps. It is possible with overset meshes that a single fringe point may actually lie in several overlapping meshes (though in typical usage, linkage to only one of the overlapping meshes is kept). There is no restriction against a given fringe point being contained within multiple instances of mismatched mesh connection; therefore, this structure allows the description of a single fringe point lying in several overlapping meshes.

<p>
All the interface patches for a given mesh in the group are contained in the multiple mesh - block entity for that group. If a face of a mesh touches several other meshes (say N), the N different instances of the mesh connectivity structure must be included in the multiple -
mesh block to describe each interface patch.
</p>
<note>This convention requires that a single interface patch be described twice - once for each adjacent mesh. It also means that the multiple mesh block is symmetrical with regard to interface patches.
