<ext_description linkend="Mesh_topology_arm">
	A mesh is defined by its vertices and the connections between the vertices. A mesh is a connected graph.
<p><b><i>Structured mesh</i></b></p>
<p>
	In a structured mesh the cells are arranged in a regular pattern and their shapes are implied by the
	particular kind of mesh.
</p>
<p>
	A 3–D rectangular mesh is a mesh of hexahedral cells.
	Each cell is a dimensionality 3 hexahedral region defined by eight vertices forming the corners of the hexahedron.
	Each cell is bounded by six faces, where each face is the quadrilateral defined by four vertices.
	A face is limited by the four edges that connect the four vertices.

<p>
	A 2–D rectangular mesh is a mesh of quadrilaterals.
	Each cell is a dimensionality two quadrilateral region defined by four vertices forming the corners of the quadrilateral.
	Each cell is limited by the four edges that connect the four vertices.
</p>
<p>
	A 1–D mesh is of linear form. Each cell is a dimensionality one linear region bounded by two vertices.
</p>
<p>
	Indices describing a structured mesh are ordered: for 3–D (<i>i, j, k</i>); (<i>i, j</i>) is used for 2–D; and (<i>i</i>) for 1–D.
</p>
<p>
	Cell centres, face centres, and edge centres are indexed by the minimum of the connecting vertices.
</p>
<example number="1">
	For example a 2-D cell center (or face centre on a 3-D mesh) would have the conventions shown in Figure 1.
</example>
<p>
	In addition, the default beginning vertex for a regular mesh is (1, 1, 1); this means the default beginning cell centre 
	of a regular mesh is also (1, 1, 1).
</p>
<p>
	There may be locations outside the mesh itself.
	These are referred to as 'rind' or ghost points and may be associated with fictitious vertices or cell centres.
	They are distinguished from the vertices and cells making up the mesh (including its boundary vertices), 
	which are referred to as 'core' points.
</p>
<example number="2">
	Figure 2 shows a 2–D mesh with a single row of 'rind' vertices at the minimum and maximum <i>i</i>-faces.
</example>
<p>
	The mesh size (i.e., the number of 'core' vertices in each direction) is 5&#215;4.
	'Core' vertices are designated by '&#8226;', and 'rind' vertices by '&#215;'.  
	Default indexing is also shown for the vertices.
</p>
<p>
	For a mesh, the minimum faces in each coordinate direction are denoted <i>i</i>-min, <i>j</i>-min and <i>k</i>-min; 
	the maximum faces are denoted <i>i</i>-max, <i>j</i>-max and <i>k</i>-max.
	These are the minimum and maximum 'core' faces.
</p>
<example number="3">
	The value <i>i</i>-min denotes the face or mesh plane whose core vertices have minimum <i>i</i> index (which if using default indexing is 1).
</example>

<p><b><i>Unstructured mesh</i></b></p>
<p>
	An unstructured mesh is composed of cells, where the cells need not form a regular pattern and the shape
	of the cells is not restricted to be uniform throughout the mesh.
	Cells have vertices at their corners and may also have nodes on cell edges, cell faces, and in the interior of the cell.
</p>
<p>
	Each cell in an irregular mesh has at least one vertex in common with at least one other cell in the mesh.
	The connectivity and adjacency of the cells may be determined from the common vertices.
</p>
<p>
	Each cell in an unstructured mesh is explicitly represented in terms of its shape and an ordered list of its vertices.
	The vertices are implied rather than being explicitly represented.
	Essentially all the vertices in a mesh can be mapped to a sequential list, 
	and reference to a vertex is then equivalent to specifying the particular position in the list.
