	<issue id="Message-1" type="arm" linkend="Message_arm.message_definer_select" category="major_technical" by="Sean barker" date="02-09-17" status="closed">
		<description>
The message_definer_select is currently an empty extensible select. it is intended to select person, organisation, or part_actual, where part_actual is some piece of built-in test equipent, etc. Is this the correct approach, with values being bound by some higher level module? Or should this be defined for all time here?
   </description>
		<comment by="Rob Bodington" date="03-01-12">

				<p>
    The definition of
    Message.defined_by says "This identifies who (person or
    person-in-organisation) or what defined the message, that is, identified
    its purpose and contents."
  </p>
				<p>
    Therefore this select should include, person and
    person_and_organization. It should also be extensible to allow for a position defining
    the message.
  </p>

Select explicity references person_in_organization and organization. Direct reference to
person is generally not needed in the STEP context.

		<description>
If contents item is represented by an extensible select, this would create a huge obligation to provide the required mappings with conferring any great benefit. Consequently the problem has been sidestepped by creating a creating an uninterpretted self-reference mechanism. To do this properly would require a change to EXPRESS.

		Problem Description:
The use of message always requires the use of the escape mechanism to reference items, whereas, in some cases an AP may wish to restrict the usage to particular entities.

Suggest:
The entity Content_item should be subtyped (oneof) to Content_item_selected and Content_item_reference
Content_item would become an abstract type, and the current attributes migrated to Onservation_item_reference
Content_item_selected would have a single attribute pointing to an extensible select.

Additional Notes:
An AP could chose to define the set of things an observation is restricted to by a rule allowing only the Content_item_select subtype and extending the associated select.
