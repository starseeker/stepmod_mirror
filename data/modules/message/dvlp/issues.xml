  <description>
The message_definer_select is currently an empty extensible select. it is intended to select person, organisation, or part_actual, where part_actual is some piece of built-in test equipent, etc. Is this the correct approach, with values being bound by some higher level module? Or should this be defined <I>for all time</I> here?

  <p>
    The definition of
    Message.defined_by says "This identifies who (person or
    person-in-organisation) or what defined the message, that is, identified
    its purpose and contents."
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore this select should include, person and
    person_and_organization. It should also be extensible to allow for a position defining
    the message.

Select explicity references person_in_organization and organization. Direct reference to
person is generally not needed in the STEP context.

I'm not sure that NO MAPPING is valid.
Could this not be mapped to group? Or do we need to raise a SEDS on Part41?
