  <description>
The message_definer_select is currently an empty extensible select. it is intended to select person, organisation, or part_actual, where part_actual is some piece of built-in test equipent, etc. Is this the correct approach, with values being bound by some higher level module? Or should this be defined for all time here?

    The definition of
    Message.defined_by says "This identifies who (person or
    person-in-organisation) or what defined the message, that is, identified
    its purpose and contents."
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore this select should include, person and
    person_and_organization. It should also be extensible to allow for a position defining
    the message.

Select explicity references person_in_organization and organization. Direct reference to
person is generally not needed in the STEP context.

I'm not sure that NO MAPPING is valid.
Could this not be mapped to group? Or do we need to raise a SEDS on Part41?

The mapping refpath should always start with the AIM entity to which the ARM
entity has been mapped.

<description>
If contents item is represented by an extensible select, this would create a huge obligation to provide the required mappings with conferring any great benefit. Consequently the problem has been sidestepped by creating a creating an uninterpretted self-reference mechanism. To do this properly would require a change to EXPRESS.

  containing_message is currently a subtype of
  applied_group_assignment with the items redeclared. This is illegal
  EXPRESS. 
  Suggest that containing_message is a
  changed to be a subtype of group_assignment with containing_message
  declared in  containing_message. I.e.
  <screen>
ENTITY containing_message
  SUBTYPE OF (group_assignment);
  SELF\group_assignment.assigned_group : message_contents_group;
  containing_message : SET[1:1] OF message_having_contents;
END_ENTITY;

NOTE - no longer need to use from group_assignment
