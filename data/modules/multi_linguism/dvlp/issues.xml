		<description>In clause 5.2.2.3: multi_language_attribute_assignment  has no attributes to classifiy . Therefore is the intent for attribute_language_assignment   to classify the items of multi_language_attribute_assignment ?  Not clear from part 41 that this is possible.
I dimly recall that AP214 had achieved an agreement that this was an acceptable approach, but it should be explained somewhere.

Sounds like an issue against P41 and not on the module. The ARM of the module it seems clear enough. So, reject the issue or propose to transfer it to the issue log of P41.

No. Not needed in the module. The character set is dealt with in Part 21.
