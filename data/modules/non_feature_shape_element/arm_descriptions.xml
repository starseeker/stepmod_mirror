A <b>Seating_plane</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Non_feature_shape_element"/> 
included specifically for the purpose of providing a description of a plane simulating a mounting surface.
One primary usage in that purpose is synchronizing the two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of a package.
The seating plane simulates the interconnect substrate surface in the definition view of a package, 
where it is referenced in the role of a package seating plane or die seating plane.  
When represented by a three-dimensional plane the normal shall represent the vector originating at the mating surface and extending away from that surface.  
The normal vector shall be in the Z axis and shall be at the origin of the defining coordinate system for the three-dimensional case.

A <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Non_feature_shape_element"/> that is annotation graphic included in the design model for a pcb.

The geometric representation for a <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> is identical to the geometric representation of the <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/> for a product that is a tool, usually a phototool.  

</p><note number="1">
The difference between a <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> and a  <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/> is that the <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> is annotation and therefore is not to be operated on as part of the design geometric model wheras the  <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/> is a real feature of the tool model and is operated on as part of the tool geometric model.

<note number="2">
<p>
<b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b>s are included for complete CAD to CAD data exchange purposes since many 2D CAD applications include geometry representing these tooling marks as part of the standard CAD file output.
