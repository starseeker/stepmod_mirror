A <b>Seating_plane</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Non_feature_shape_element"/> included specifically for the purpose of providing a description of an interface plane.
One primary usage in that purpose is synchronizing the two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of a package.  The seating plane simulates a mating feature when referenced as an interface_plane.
The seating plane simulates the interconnect substrate surface in the definition view of a package, where it is referenced in the role of a package_<b>seating_plane</b> or die_<b>seating_plane</b>.  When represented by a three-dimensional plane the normal shall represent the mating surface.  The normal vector shall be in the Z axis and shall be at the origin of the defining coordinate system for the three-dimensional case.  A <b>Seating_plane</b> scope shall be a  <express_ref linkend="Bare_die:arm:Bare_die_arm.Bare_die"/>, or a  <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package"/>.

A <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Non_feature_shape_element"/> that is annotation graphic included in the design model for a pcb.  A set of <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> is used to visually indicate a reference alignment for tooling purposes.
The geometric representation for a <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> is identical to the geometric representation of the <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/> for a product that is a tool, usually a phototool.  

<note number="1">
The difference between a <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> and a  <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/> is that the <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> is annotation and therefore is not to be operated on as part of the design geometric model wheras the  <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/> is a real feature of the tool model and is operated on as part of the tool geometric model.
</note>
<note number="2">
<b>Reference_graphic_registration_marks</b> are included for complete CAD to CAD data exchange purposes since many 2D CAD applications include geometry representing these tooling marks as part of the standard CAD file output.

A <b>Non_feature_shape_composition_relationship</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Foundation_representation:arm:Foundation_representation_arm.Representation_relationship"/>. A <b>Non_feature_shape_composition_relationship</b> is the association of a <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Non_feature_shape_definition"/> with its <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Axis_placement"/> to create a resultant <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Non_feature_shape_definition"/>.  In the case where the placement is not supplied, both Non_feature_shape_definitions are in the same geometric context.
<note>
A <b>Non_feature_shape_composition_relationship</b> is included to support composition of Non_feature and non-physical shapes.  Component_2d_location and other types of location Application Objects support composition of assembly or interconnect shapes.  Usage_concept_usage_view_relationship supports composition of shapes in the usage view.  The name is generic to support extensibility.
Mirroring is possible by use of Cartesian_transformation_operator.  The use of mirroring should be carefully considered toavoid confusion in receiving systems.
</note>
<example>
A <b>Non_feature_shape_composition_relationship</b> would be used to transform a keepout shape for a detail into an overall keepout shape.  It may be that the detail shape is a  <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_2d_shape:arm:Physical_unit_2d_shape_arm.Physical_unit_planar_keepout_shape"/>.
