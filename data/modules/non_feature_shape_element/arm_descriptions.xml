</p><note number="1">
The difference between a <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> and a  <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/> is that the <b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b> is annotation and therefore is not to be operated on as part of the design geometric model wheras the  <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/> is a real feature of the tool model and is operated on as part of the tool geometric model.

<p>
<b>Reference_graphic_registration_mark</b>s are included for complete CAD to CAD data exchange purposes since many 2D CAD applications include geometry representing these tooling marks as part of the standard CAD file output.
