This attribute can't be redeclared from SELF\Shape_element.containing_shape as some options 
in extensible select are not compatible with original type of SELF\Shape_element.containing_shape attribute -
Item_shape. Need to make this attribute simple and not redecalred. Also SELF\Shape_element.containing_shape needs to be somehow forbidden to be set as it
is overlapping with scope.
The only item which is not subtype of item_shape is Stratum (added in layered_interconnect_module_design).
So maybe just remove it?
