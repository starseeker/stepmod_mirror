An <b>Observation</b> is an historical record about any entity. The types of entity it may refer to are defined by a higher level module that uses <b>observation</b>.
The observation content may consist of a description only, or may include multiple data records. The types of records are defined by a higher level module that uses <b>observation</b>.
<b>Observation</b> also enables the recording of the context, the observers, any automatic equipement generating observation data and the observation date.
An <b>Observation</b> may also be classified, authorised and associated to other obsesrvations. It may also be associated to any <express_ref linkend="work_request:arm:Work_request_arm.Work_request"/> that follows as a result.

This creates two operational problems: firstly, what happens when the information content of the record changes, and secondly, what is the extent of the information
that the <b>observation_contents</b> applies to - just the entity pointed to, or the entity plus any other associated entities, as for example, when the entity is a product, does the <b>Observation</b>
also refer to its product structure? These issues should be addressed by business rules, and are outside the scope of this standard. </note>
