 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of Observation.
     An observation provides a place to note down the relation of an observed fact to thing which it describes, and link it to any consequence that may result. It is intended to be used in two ways. Firstly, it provides a general mechanism to link the unexpected to the well defined world of the product and its design. Secondly, it provides a defined mechanism for reporting observations within the context of the standard, given that the set of observations required will vary between products and organisations.</p>
     <p>For example, a crack may occur in the wall of a container. Observation allows the fact that the crack has appeared to simply be noted. Subsequent inspections required by the organisation may then want to record the size of the crack. Since a crack is not a design feature, this cannot be done directly in the design data for the container, nor do the design data standards allow for multiple historical observations
   </p>
