 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation 
     of information needed to manage the life cycle process of developing and using 
     a system such that qualified persons and organizations can be assigned to projects.</p> 
     <p>Systems Engineering encompasses the design and specification of systems, and 
   the planning and management of the engineering processes that design, manufacture, 
   field, and support that system. This module captures information concerning 
   organizations and persons associated with those organizations along with useful 
   relationships to experience and qualifications. That information is needed to manage 
   the life cycle process of developing and using a system such that qualified persons 
   and organizations can be assigned to projects.
   </p>
   <p>This AP233 business case module is constructed from several ISO/TS Application 
   modules:</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="organization_type:introduction"/> 
   captures the definition of the types of organizations 
   that project management deals with.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="person_organization:introduction"/> 
   captures definitions of a person and an 
   organization with related information. It captures the definition of a relationship 
   between two organizations and the identification of a person in the context of an 
   organization. It captures the definition of an address for persons or organizations, 
   and the assignment of an address to a person in an organization or to an organization.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="experience:introduction"/> 
   captures the kinds of experience that is relevant to a 
   project. It associates experience with persons and organizations.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="position_in_organization:introduction"/> 
   captures the definition of a position 
   in an organization and the definition of types of positions. It captures the 
   several relationships among positions and organizations.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="qualifications:introduction"/> 
   provides the information needed by management to 
   match persons and organizations to projects based on the skills needed for tasks, 
   and the qualifications of the people/organizations. It captures the identification 
   of qualifications and the association of qualifications with a person or an organization.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="type_of_person:introduction"/> 
   captures the definition of a type of person and 
   the relationships between definitions of a type of person. It captures the association 
   of a type of person in a role with an activity or product data, the classification of 
   types of person, and the specification of required attributes for a type of person 
   including qualifications and experience. It does not capture information relating to 
   an individual person.</p>
