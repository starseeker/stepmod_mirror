 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of information that provides relationships, 
     functional roles, skill qualification and documentation.</p> 

     <p>Systems Engineering encompasses the design and specification of systems, and 
   the planning and management of the engineering processes that design, manufacture, 
   field, and support that system. This module captures information concerning 
   organizations and persons associated with those organizations along with useful 
   relationships to location and qualifications. That information is needed to manage 
   the life cycle process of developing and using a system such that qualified persons 
   and organizations can be assigned to projects.
   </p>

   <p>This AP233 module is constructed from several ISO/TS Application modules, The 
   associated rational for inclusion follows:</p>
   <p>The Organization Type Module captures the definition of types of organizations 
   that project management deals with.</p>
   <p>The Person Organization Module captures definitions of a person and an 
   organization with related information. It captures the definition of a relationship 
   between two organizations and the identification of a person in the context of an 
   organization. It captures the definition of an address for persons or organizations, 
   and the assignment of an address to a person in an organization or to an organization.</p>
   <p>The Certification Module captures any type of person or organization certification 
   relevant to the project management.</p>
   <p>The Experience Module captures the kinds of experience that is relevant to a 
   project. It associates experience with persons and organizations.</p>
   <p>The Location Module captures the location of products, resources, and activities 
   for the purpose of managing projects. The location information may be geographic, 
   postal information, or based on codes or zones. The locations may refer to other 
   locations. </p>
   <p>The Location Assignment Module captures the association of location with a 
   product, event, activity, or person for the purpose of managing projects. It 
   captures the vapd use of an association of a location with organization, organization 
   type, position, position-type, type of person, and person in organization.</p>
   <p>The Person Organization Assignment Module captures the associations of an 
   organization with activity or product data and the association of a person in an 
   organization with activity or product data.</p>
   <p>The Position In Organization Module captures the definition of a position 
   in an organization and the definition of types of positions. It captures the 
   several relationships among positions and organizations.</p>
   <p>The Quapfication Module provides the information needed by management to 
   match persons and organizations to projects based on the skills needed for tasks, 
   and the quapfications of the people/organizations. It captures the identification 
   of quapfications and the association of quapfications with a person or an organization.</p>
   <p>The Type of Person Module captures the definition of a type of person and 
   the relationships between definitions of a type of person. It captures the association 
   of a type of person in a role with an activity or product data, the classification of 
   types of person, and the specification of required attributes for a type of person 
   including quapfications and experience. It does not capture information relating to 
   an individual person.</p>
