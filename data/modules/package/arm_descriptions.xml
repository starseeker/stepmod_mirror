A <b>Guided_wave_terminal</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package_terminal"/>

A <b>Package</b> is a type of a <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_usage_view"/>. A <b>Package</b> may be a <express_ref linkend="Altered_package:arm:Altered_package_arm.Altered_package"/>. A <b>Package</b> describes the physical container of a <express_ref linkend="Packaged_part_black_box_model:arm:Packaged_part_black_box_model_arm.Packaged_part"/>. A <b>Package</b> includes no more than one <b>package</b> <b>body</b> and one or more <b>package</b> terminals.
A <b>Package</b> orientation is defined using a <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/>, which references the <b>Package</b> as a scope.
It is possible to have several  <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/> referencing a <b>Package</b> due to the need to support multiple <express_ref linkend="Unknown:arm:Unknown_arm.Datum_system"/>.
The simplest case is one shape for a <b>Package</b>, with one  <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/> which is at the centroid of the <b>Package</b> shape.
Since <b>Package</b> and  <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/> are not themselves interpreted as shape_representations, it is the usual case that there will be one <b>Package</b>,  <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/> combination even though there may be multiple shape_representations for the <b>Package</b>, and each of those shape_representations are in a geometric context that also includes an <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Axis_placement"/> that is the placement transformation of the shape of the  <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/> in that shape_representation.
There shall be no more than one <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Primary_reference_terminal"/> for a <b>Package</b>.
<note>
The shape of the  <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/> itself is required to only include one <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Detailed_geometric_model_element"/>, an  <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Axis_placement"/> at the origin of the shape definition.  The shape of the  <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/> is required to be a <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame_shape_definition"/>.

<ext_description linkend="Package_arm.Primary_reference_terminal">
A <b>Primary_reference_terminal</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package_terminal"/>.
This terminal is assigned the identifier string that is first in the 
sequence of package terminal names to be assigned to the part.  The <b>Primary_reference_terminal</b>
shall not specify a precedent_feature and is the first member of the sequence of  <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Package_terminal"/>.
The sort order of the names assigned to the Packaged_terminals is defined
by the explicit sequence established by the use of precedent_feature inherited from  <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/>.
<example>
If a value of '1' is available, assigning a value of '2' to this terminal 
would be prohibited by this part of ISO 10303, due to the possibility of confusion.

<note>
The <b>Primary_reference_terminal</b> is often associated with an orientation 
feature, but it may not be the orientation feature itself.  Usually the 
<b>Primary_reference_terminal</b> and the 
 <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Primary_orientation_feature"/> are

<ext_description linkend="Package_arm.Functional_orientation_feature">
A <b>Functional_orientation_feature</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/>. A <b>Functional_orientation_feature</b> provides 
visible or tactile means to reduce or eliminate ambiguity of the location of a <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Primary_reference_terminal"/> 
in an assembly operation. A <b>Functional_orientation_feature</b> augments the  <express_ref linkend="Extended_geometric_tolerance:arm:Extended_geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_reference_frame"/> basis for orientation in the CAD system 
and acts as a mapping operator between the CAD model and the real world.
<note>
Other orientation information may be required in addition to the <b>Functional_orientation_feature</b> to totally disambiguate the correct 
orientation.
</note>
<example>
A mark on a component implemented with ink or a visible indentation or a formed corner may be used to indicate the fact that pin one 
of the package is in close proximity to the mark.  A vision system or a human operator will use the mark to correctly orient the 
component.
