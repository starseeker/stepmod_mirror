A <b>Package</b> may be a <express_ref linkend="Altered_package:arm:Altered_package_arm.Altered_package"/>.

A <b>Package</b> includes no more than one package <b>body</b> and one or more package terminals.
A <b>Package</b> orientation is defined using aDatum_reference_frame, which references the <b>Package</b> as a scope.
It is possible to have several Datum_reference_frame referencing a <b>Package</b> due to the need to support multipleDatum_system.
The simplest case is one shape for a <b>Package</b>, with one Datum_reference_frame which is at the centroid of the <b>Package</b> shape.
Since <b>Package</b> and Datum_reference_frame are not themselves interpreted as shape_representations, it is the usual case that there will be one <b>Package</b>, Datum_reference_frame combination even though there may be multiple shape_representations for the <b>Package</b>, and each of those shape_representations are in a geometric context that also includes an <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Axis_placement"/> that is the placement transformation of the shape of the Datum_reference_frame in that shape_representation.
There shall be no more than one <express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Primary_reference_terminal"/> for a <b>Package</b>.
</p><note>
The shape of the Datum_reference_frame itself is required to only include one <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Detailed_geometric_model_element"/>, an  <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Axis_placement"/> at the origin of the shape definition.
