 <note number="5">
  Constraints WR6, WR7 and WR8 exist to support user-defined ordering because this part of ISO 10303 does not predefine an order on the terminals.
  Data that satisfies the constraints will have the properties of a list with unique entries; the list may have missing entries.
 </note>
 <example number="5">
  A BGA definition includes a set of relationships that declare that the terminal labeled "AB1" is earlier in the numbering sequence than "BC2".
  Some of the grid intersections do not have terminals so the grid has voids.
 </example>
 <example number="6">
  A six pin SIP definition has terminals labeled "1" through "6" inclusively.

A <b>Visual_orientation_feature</b> is a type of 
<express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/>. 
A <b>Visual_orientation_feature</b> provides visible or tactile means to reduce or eliminate ambiguity of the location of a 
<express_ref linkend="Package:arm:Package_arm.Primary_reference_terminal"/> 
in an assembly operation. 
</p>
	<note>
	Other orientation information may be required in addition to the <b>Visual_orientation_feature</b> to totally disambiguate the correct 
	orientation.
	</note>
<example>
A mark on a component implemented with ink or a visible indentation or a formed corner may be used to indicate the fact that pin one 
of the package is in close proximity to the mark.  A vision system or a human operator will use the mark to correctly orient the 
component.
