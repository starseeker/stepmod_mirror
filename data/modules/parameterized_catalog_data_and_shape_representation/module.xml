This application module 		provides specifications suitable for the representation of any kind of such products. In particular, this 		application module enables the representation of products proposed to market with a great number of 		variants and whose composition is characterized due to the selection among a set of different product 		features. 		</p>				<example>		Examples of such products are the products developed by the furniture industry, the automotive industry 		and the commercial airplane industry.		</example>				<p>		This application module specifies the data types and their constraints. It specifies the conformance class 1 		of ISO 10303-236.		</p>		<p>A catalogue contains a list of references of different commercial products that are proposed to customers 		or to distributors. A catalogue provides a commercial view of the products of a supplier or manufacturer but it 		does not represent the design information of the commercial products.		</p>		<p>		It also provides information about the planned usage of components in a product model.		</p>		<p>		The core of the product model is catalogue information. This information is connected to other parts in order to 		define the geometry of the products and to select a set of product features.		</p>		<p> 		This application module provides the definition for the main information data of a catalogue, such as the definition 		of a product (and its different versions) and its specifications (the features of a product that the customer can 		chose in order to select one product from another). The structure of the product (the product itself or the 		decomposition of the product in its components), the effectivity of the catalogue itself or its products, the effectivity 		of the prices of the products, documents (hardcopies or digital files) that gives additional information about the 		product such as detailed information, pictures, technical drawings, and a classification of the products in order 		they could be found easily in a catalogue depending on different search criteria; the properties of the product (not 		selectable by the user). It specifies the main concepts for representing a catalogue specification in the 		<module_ref linkend="product_class:introduction">ISO 1303-1103</module_ref> (Product class). It also adds to the 		catalog data information the capability of including the geometry of the products. It includes application modules for 		the representation of geometric models, surface conditions, geometric tolerances, dimensions that characterize the 		shape of product components, through subtypes of the generic type 		<express_ref linkend="elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Geometric_model">Geometric 		Model</express_ref>.		</p>		<p>		In particular, this application module enables the representation of products proposed to market with a great number 		of variants and whose composition is characterized with expressions of operands selected in a set of product 		features.		</p>				<note>		This application module is an extension of the Catalog_data_information module.		</note>				<p>		This application module specifies the schema associated with conformance class 2 of application protocol ISO 		10303-236.		</p>	</purpose>		<!-- Items in scope -->	<inscope>		<li>representation of catalog of product data definition;</li>		<li>representation of catalog product stucture;</li>		<li>modular products as a representation of products;</li>		<li>variants and options of products;</li>		<li>products classification and specification control;</li>		<li>produtcs dimensions of shape elements;</li>		<li>representation of products price lists;</li>		<li>different product configuration based on specific characteristics;</li>		<li>multi-language support;</li>		<li>effectivity;</li>		<li>documents definition and assignment to describe products;</li>		<li>product manufacturing configuration;</li>		<li>parameterized properties for products based on expressions and using other product property values;</li>		<li>establishment of relationships between variables and properties;</li>		<li>surface conditions;</li>		<li>geometric tolerance.</li>	</inscope>		<!-- Items out of scope -->	<outscope>		<li>room space definition and representation;</li>		<li>product placement and interior decoration project;</li>		<li>work management data;</li>		<li>products constraints based on expressions;</li>		<li>variants and options based on expressions.</li>	</outscope>	<!-- Clause 4 ARM  -->	<arm>		<!-- Note ARM short form EXPRESS is in arm.xml -->		<!-- Short form EXPRESS-G -->		<express-g>			<imgfile file="armexpg1.xml"/>		</express-g>	</arm>		<!-- ARM long form (optional) -->	<arm_lf/>		<!-- Clause 5.2 MIM -->	<mim>		<!--  Note MIM short form express is in mim.xml -->		<express-g>			<imgfile file="mimexpg1.xml"/>		</express-g>	</mim>		<!-- MIM long form (optional) -->	<mim_lf/>	</module>
