A <b>Part</b> is a type of <b>Product</b> that collects the definitional information of the versions of 
either a <module_ref linkend="part_and_version_identification:3_definition">part</module_ref> or of a 
<module_ref linkend="part_and_version_identification:3_definition">non-countable material</module_ref>.

<note number="1">A <b>Part</b> does not represent an object that is or was existing in the real world. Representation of such objects is the subject of the <b>Product_as_realized</b> module.</note>	 
<note number="2">A complex instance of the <b>Part</b> entity and of the <express_ref linkend="Document_and_version_identification:arm:Document_and_version_identification_arm.Document">Document</express_ref> entity may be created in order to represent a document that is a component of a manufactured product, for example a user manual of a car.
	</note>
	
<p>If the <b>Part</b> represents a non-countable material that is used as a component in an assembly, the <b>Part</b> shall be, in addition, referred to by a <b>Product_category_association</b> and the associated category shall have the name 'non-countable material'.</p>
<note number="3">This association is needed for a correct determination of the respective quantity of the components of the assembly.</note>
