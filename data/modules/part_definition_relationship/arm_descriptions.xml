A <b>Make_from_relationship</b> is a type of <b>View_definition_usage</b> established between two instances of <b>Part_view_definition</b>
It specifies that, in the context of the definition of the relating part version, the relating part version is considered as resulting from the manufacturing transformation 
of the related part version.

The related part version may identify a raw material or a semi-finished part.

not an absolute ranking. A lower value indicates a higher preference for the related_view, and
a higher value indicates a lower preference. The value of this attribute need not be specified.
