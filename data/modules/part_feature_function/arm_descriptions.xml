A <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> is a type of 
<express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/>.  
A <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> may be one of a
<express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Fiducial_part_feature"/> 
or a
<express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/>, 
or additionally may be a
<express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Test_point_part_feature"/>.
A <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> identifies a feature for tooling purposes.  A feature may be used for other purposes or may intrinsically be in a particular feature category, and in either of those cases the feature would be a <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> and also the other type of feature. 
</p><note>
Tooling purposes as used herein includes test instrumentation and measurement purposes, not just inspection, fabrication and assembly tooling.
</note>
<example>
Examples of a <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> include, but are not limited, to slots, passages, notches defined by Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing methodology, as well as fiducials, and photo tool and mask alignment marks. 
</example>

<!-- +++++++++++ Fiducial_part_feature +++++++++++ -->
<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Fiducial_part_feature">

A <b>Fiducial_part_feature</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Part_tooling_feature"/>. A <b>Fiducial_part_feature</b> identifies a feature for 
product alignment with respect to a tool.

<!-- +++++++++++ Tool_registration_mark +++++++++++ -->
<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"><p>
A <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Part_tooling_feature"/> that is used to visually indicate a reference alignment for tooling purposes.
The geometric representation for a <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> is identical to the geometric representation of the <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Reference_graphic_registration_mark"/> that is part of the annotation for a pcb design.  

</p><note number="1">
The difference between a  <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Reference_graphic_registration_mark"/> and a <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> is that the <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Reference_graphic_registration_mark"/> is annotation and therefore is not to be operated on as part of the design geometric model wheras the <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> is a real feature of the tool model and is operated on as part of the tool geometric model.
</note>
<note number="2">
In the case that tooling alignment registration marks are placed inside the outline of the pcb, <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> would be used instead of  <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Reference_graphic_registration_mark"/> since the graphic directly affect the design shape.
</note>
<note number="3">
<p>
<b>Tool_registration_mark</b>s are included for manufacturing purposes, specifcally for ensuring accurate orientation and location of a set of photools in a fabrication facility.
</p>
</note>
<note number="4">
The <b>Tool_registration_mark</b>s may be included in a design of a product category with an industry accepted name of "panel".  This standard supports that usage by applications identifying a pcb as being an  <express_ref linkend="Product_view_definition:arm:Product_view_definition_arm.Product_view_definition"/> for a product in the 'panel' category. In this application the <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> would be included as part of the product geometric model.

	that is 
	identified to facilitate tolerance specification when an occurrence of the associated part is used in an assembly.  Specifically, the intent is to provide identification that the function of the  <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/> is to provide access via a void in the material to internal components or terminals which have been identified as having some function at the  <express_ref linkend="Part_and_version_identification:arm:Part_and_version_identification_arm.Part"/> level.
	<example number="1"><express_ref linkend="Functional_assignment_to_part:arm:Functional_assignment_to_part_arm.Part_terminal">Part_terminals</express_ref> is an example of internal terminal in the material.
