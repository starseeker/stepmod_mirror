<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Part_tooling_feature"><p>
A <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/>.  A <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> may be one of either a <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Fiducial_part_feature"/> or of a <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"/>, or may be a  <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Test_point_part_feature"/>.
A <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> identifies a feature for tooling purposes.  A feature may be used for other purposes or may intrinsically be in a particular feature category, and in either of those cases the feature would be a <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> and also the other type of feature. 
</p><note>
Tooling purposes as used herein includes test instrumentation and measurement purposes, not just inspection, fabrication and assembly tooling.
</note>
<example>
Examples of a <b>Part_tooling_feature</b> include, but are not limited, to slots, passages, notches defined by Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing methodology, as well as fiducials, and photo tool and mask alignment marks. 
</example>
</ext_description>
<!-- +++++++++++ Test_point_part_feature +++++++++++ -->
<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Test_point_part_feature"><p>
A <b>Test_point_part_feature</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Part_tooling_feature"/>. A <b>Test_point_part_feature</b> identifies a feature for use with test instrumentation. 
</p><note>
A <b>Test_point_part_feature</b> may be related to a <express_ref linkend="Layered_interconnect_module_design:arm:Layered_interconnect_module_design_arm.Probe_access_area"/> if the layout view is also supplied.

<!-- +++++++++++ Fiducial_part_feature +++++++++++ -->
<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Fiducial_part_feature">

A <b>Fiducial_part_feature</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Part_tooling_feature"/>. A <b>Fiducial_part_feature</b> identifies a feature for 
product alignment with respect to a tool. 
</ext_description>
<!-- +++++++++++ Tool_registration_mark +++++++++++ -->
<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Tool_registration_mark"><p>
A <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_function:arm:Part_feature_function_arm.Part_tooling_feature"/> that is used to visually indicate a reference alignment for tooling purposes.
The geometric representation for a <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> is identical to the geometric representation of the <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Reference_graphic_registration_mark"/> that is part of the annotation for a pcb design.  

</p><note number="1">
The difference between a  <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Reference_graphic_registration_mark"/> and a <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> is that the <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Reference_graphic_registration_mark"/> is annotation and therefore is not to be operated on as part of the design geometric model wheras the <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> is a real feature of the tool model and is operated on as part of the tool geometric model.
</note>
<note number="2">
In the case that tooling alignment registration marks are placed inside the outline of the pcb, <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> would be used instead of  <express_ref linkend="Non_feature_shape_element:arm:Non_feature_shape_element_arm.Reference_graphic_registration_mark"/> since the graphic directly affect the design shape.
</note>
<note number="3">
<b>Tool_registration_mark</b>s are included for manufacturing purposes, specifcally for ensuring accurate orientation and location of a set of photools in a fabrication facility. 
</note>
<note number="4">
The <b>Tool_registration_mark</b>s may be included in a design of a product category with an industry accepted name of "panel".  This standard supports that usage by applications identifying a pcb as being an  <express_ref linkend="Product_view_definition:arm:Product_view_definition_arm.Product_view_definition"/> for a product in the 'panel' category. In this application the <b>Tool_registration_mark</b> would be included as part of the product geometric model.

<!-- +++++++++++ Part_interface_access_feature +++++++++++ -->
<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Part_interface_access_feature">

A <b>Part_interface_access_feature</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/> that is 
identified to facilitate tolerance specification when an occurrence of the associated part is used in an assembly.  Specifically the intent is to provide identification that the function of the  <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/> is to provide access via a void in the material to internal components or terminals, which have been identified as having some function at the  <express_ref linkend="Part_and_version_identification:arm:Part_and_version_identification_arm.Part"/> level, e.g., are <express_ref linkend="Part_terminal:arm:Part_terminal_arm.Part_terminal">Part_terminals</express_ref>.  The <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature.material_state_change"/> attribute inherited from  <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/> shall be <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature.material_state_change">material_removal</express_ref>.
<!--Eco2-->
<example>
The reset button in a notebook computer requires a <b>Part_interface_access_feature</b> whose properties are coupled to the reset button to ensure correct functionality of the end product.

<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Part_interface_access_feature.interface_access_area">
the <b>interface_access_area</b> specifies the role of the <express_ref linkend="Feature_and_connection_zone:arm:Feature_and_connection_zone_arm.Connection_zone"/> for the <b>Part_interface_access_feature</b>. 
There shall be one or more  <express_ref linkend="Feature_and_connection_zone:arm:Feature_and_connection_zone_arm.Connection_zone"/> for an <b>interface_access_area</b>. The value of this attribute need not be supplied.
The <b>interface_access_area</b> provides a means to geometrically specify an area for critical mechanical interface access properties.  
The  <express_ref linkend="Feature_and_connection_zone:arm:Feature_and_connection_zone_arm.Connection_zone"/> area is void of material.

<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Part_interface_access_feature.accessed_interface"><p>
the <b>accessed_interface</b> specifies the role of the <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/> for the <b>Part_interface_access_feature</b>.  
The <b>accessed_interface</b> is the feature for which the <b>Part_interface_access_feature</b> provides access.
</p><note>
The <b>accessed_interface</b> is at the same level of design hierarchy as the <b>Part_interface_access_feature</b> for consistency purposes.
It is anticipated that  <express_ref linkend="Component_feature:arm:Component_feature_arm.Component_feature_to_physical_usage_view_assignment"/> will be populated as necessary to support the design process peculiar to the enterprise.

<ext_description linkend="Part_feature_function_arm.Part_mating_feature">

A <b>Part_mating_feature</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Physical_unit_usage_view:arm:Physical_unit_usage_view_arm.Part_feature"/> that is 
identified to facilitate tolerance specification when an occurrence of the associated part is mated to a complementary part.  A <b>Part_mating_feature</b> is provided where there is no requirement to convey electrical functionality as would be provided by  <express_ref linkend="Part_terminal:arm:Part_terminal_arm.Part_terminal"/>.
<!--Eco2-->
<note>
The use of multi-pin connectors may require specification of mechanical mating areas in addition to electrical terminals.
