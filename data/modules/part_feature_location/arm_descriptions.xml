A <b>Usage_concept_usage_relationship</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Shape_feature:arm:Shape_feature_arm.Geometric_model_constituent_relationship"/>.
 A <b>Usage_concept_usage_relationship</b> is the association between a <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_location:arm:Part_feature_location_arm.usage_concept"/> as a source and a 
 <express_ref linkend="Part_feature_location:arm:Part_feature_location_arm.feature_or_non_feature_usage"/> as a target. This relationship positions and orients the geometric model of the source into the model of the 
target using a transformation.
