Page 16 section 4.2.4.3 Status
	     The status of an approval is supposed to be "approved" or "not  approved" 
	according to the object description page 16 while page 176 proposes 4 approval 
	status in the AIM: "approved", "not yet approved"; "disapproved" and 
	"withdrawn". 
	
	     Suggested solution:
	     The text page 16 should be changed to be consistent with the AIM.
	     
	     Page 23 section 4.2.19.4 Part_type
	     The description of the possible part_types are not consistent with  what is 
	said page 153. In particular, the "customer supplied material" must be replaced 
	by "customer furnished equipment"; and the part_type value "government" is 
	not existing in the AIM rule of pages 152 and 153. 
	     Suggested solution
	     Modify the text of the section 4.2.19.4 so that it is consistent with the 
	authorized values in pages 152 and 153.
	     
	     Page 36 section 4.3.23 Assertion from Product_configuration to Part. 
	The assertion indicates a relationship from Product_configuration  to Part while 
	it should be from Product_configuration to Part_version. 
	
	     Suggested solution:
	     Change the assertion. The mapping table and the AIM are already reflecting 
	the corrected assertion.
	     
	     Page 54 mapping of Change date 
	     Date_time_role.name ='change_date' is not compliant with the rule 52 
	"restrict_date_time_role" page 186.
	
	     Suggested solution:
	     Modify the role 'change_date' by 'start_date' in the mapping table to be 
	consistent with the rule 52.
	     
	     Page 75 mapping of standard_part_indicator
	     The attribute related_product_category and relating_product_category have 
	been replaced in the entity product_category_relationship by subcategory and 
	category. 
	     Suggested solution:
	     Modify attributes names in the mapping according to the part 41 definition.
	     
	     Page 88 Rule 37
	     The name of the rule 37 is acu_requires_security_classification and not 
	pdu_requires_security_classification as it is written.

   This SEDS was raised against AP203 edition 1 and was closed in edition 2.
   1. Approval status has been made generic, so the terms are not restricted to a particular set.
2. Part is now defined as a subtype of Product, so the mappings and values have changed accordingly
3. The mappings now reflect the new edition of Part41
4. The typo for the rule acu_requries_security_classification has been corrected.
 
The modules affected by this SEDs are:
 
Approval, part_and_version_identification, part_view_definition, and configuration_control_3d_design_ed2

The MIM is missing a rule to constrain the correlation between the 
product_definition_context and the product_category
note: such a rule is already embedded in IS APs like AP214.
Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Module development
