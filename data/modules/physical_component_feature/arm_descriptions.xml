A <b>Physical_component_feature</b> is a type of 
	<express_ref linkend="Component_feature:arm:Component_feature_arm.Component_feature"/>.
The <b>Physical_component_feature</b> supports identification of physical features that are not otherwise 
identified in a component feature classification.  <b>Physical_component_feature</b> is
only applicable to physical assembly design views and is not applicable to interconnect
design views.
</p><note number="1">
The <b>Physical_component_feature</b> is interpreted to be an aim entity  <express_ref linkend="Component_feature:arm:Component_feature_arm.Component_feature"/> when no
other information is provided in the aim population.
</note>
<note number="2">
The <b>Physical_component_feature</b> is not supporting embedded discrete components since the context of
components in the implicit role of embedded discrete component is an interconnect view.
</note>
	<note number="3">
		The <b>Physical_component_feature</b> supports the specification of a
		<express_ref linkend="Component_feature:arm:Component_feature_arm.Component_feature"/> 
		as a 
		<express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum_target"/> 
		or the specification that a 
		<express_ref linkend="Component_feature:arm:Component_feature_arm.Component_feature"/> 
		defines a 
		<express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Datum"/> 
		for the purpose of estabishing a datum reference frame for tolerance specification.
