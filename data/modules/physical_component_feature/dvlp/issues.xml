need an INVERSE
<p>INVERSE
    connected_node      : SET [0:1] OF physical_connectivity_definition FOR
                          associated_terminals;
    </p>
<p>The connected_node is an inverse relationship that specifies that the existence of the Physical_component_terminal is
dependent on the existence of the Physical_connectivity_defintion that 
specifies the Physical_component_terminal as its associated_terminals. There shall be zero or one 
Physical_connectivity_defintion for a Physical_component_terminal.
</p>
<p>
also need a REFERENCE FROM to the module physical_connectivity_definition.
