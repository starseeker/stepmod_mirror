A <b>Component_part_2d_geometric_representation_relationship</b> is a type of 
<express_ref linkend="Extended_basic_geometry:arm:Extended_basic_geometry_arm.Geometric_model_relationship"/>.
A <b>Component_part_2d_geometric_representation_relationship</b> is the association between a

<ext_description linkend="Physical_unit_2d_design_view_arm.Component_2d_location">
<p>
A <b>Component_2d_location</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Extended_basic_geometry:arm:Extended_basic_geometry_arm.Geometric_model_relationship"/>, <express_ref linkend="Extended_basic_geometry:arm:Extended_basic_geometry_arm.Definitional_representation_relationship"/>.
A <b>Component_2d_location</b> is either a <express_ref linkend="Assembly_2d_shape:arm:Assembly_2d_shape_arm.Component_2d_edge_location"/>,
a <express_ref linkend="Interconnect_2d_shape:arm:Interconnect_2d_shape_arm.Component_2d_embedded_location"/>,
a <express_ref linkend="Assembly_2d_shape:arm:Assembly_2d_shape_arm.Component_2d_stacked_location"/>,
or a <express_ref linkend="Assembly_2d_shape:arm:Assembly_2d_shape_arm.Component_2d_surface_location"/>. 
The <b>Component_2d_location</b> is the placement location, including orientation and mirroring, specified by a combination of 
description characteristics, substrate surface identification, and two-dimensional <b>transformation</b>.  
Mirroring shall not be applied to the location of a base substrate.  
Mirroring applied to <b>component</b>s other than a base substrate shall indicate that the <b>component</b>s are mounted on the surface of the 
substrate opposite to the primary surface.  
When this application object is used in this manner, there shall be only one base substrate in the assembly.  
Mirroring shall not be applied to <express_ref linkend="Layered_interconnect_module_design:arm:Layered_interconnect_module_design_arm.Laminate_component"/>. 
Support for mirroring option is mandatory for <express_ref linkend="Layered_interconnect_module_design:arm:Layered_interconnect_module_design_arm.Footprint_occurrence"/> to support <b>component</b>s mounted on the bottom surface.
The <b>transformation</b> matrix value of +1.0 shall indicate primary surface mounted <b>component</b> (un-mirrored).
The <b>transformation</b> matrix value of -1.0 shall indicate secondary surface mounted <b>component</b> (mirrored).  
A mirror requirement to mirror about the local Y axis indicates that values on the Y axis are invariant, 
while values on the X axis are assigned the negative of the original value.
</p><example>
A point at (X = 3,Y = 2) would be at (X = -3,Y = 2) after being mirrored.
</example>

<note number="1">
This standard does not support a "mounting style" attribute.
<b>component</b>s which are altered from their normal mounting arrangement (e.g., "upside down mounting style") are 
considered to be <express_ref linkend="Altered_part:arm:Altered_part_arm.Altered_packaged_part"/> in the context of this standard if the normal 
mounting arrangement is available and a relationship to that normal mounting arrangement is desired.
</note>
<note number="2">
Subtypes of this application object includes sufficient information to accurately determine machine parameters for reliable installation of a <b>component</b> on an interconnect substrate.  The use of this application object should be reservered for locating base substrates that are not themselves mounted in the design, or where the only mating condition information is encoded in the <b>transformation</b>.
</note>
<note number="3">
A  <express_ref linkend="Layered_interconnect_module_design:arm:Layered_interconnect_module_design_arm.Footprint_occurrence"/> may be for a surface whether or not there are actually <b>component</b>s in the assembly.  It is an expression of the design
intent behind the creation of the  <express_ref linkend="Layered_interconnect_module_design:arm:Layered_interconnect_module_design_arm.Footprint_occurrence"/>.
</note>
<note number="4">
A  <express_ref linkend="Layered_interconnect_module_design:arm:Layered_interconnect_module_design_arm.Padstack_occurrence"/> may also be mirrored to communicate the intent that the shape information is different for the bottom vs top arrangement.
</note>
<note number="5">
Mirroring in this case is only related to the geometric information on the individual stratum for  <express_ref linkend="Layered_interconnect_module_design:arm:Layered_interconnect_module_design_arm.Footprint_occurrence"/> and  <express_ref linkend="Layered_interconnect_module_design:arm:Layered_interconnect_module_design_arm.Padstack_occurrence"/>.
Mirroring has nothing to do with the relative location of  <express_ref linkend="Land:arm:Land_arm.Land"/> in the vertical stack.  That arrangement will not be modified by the mirror operation and
must be adjusted if necessary in the pre-processor.

If this is the location of a substrate, the mirror shall not occur.
</p><note>
Mirroring is prohibited in 2d representations of substrate <b>component</b>s in the physical assembly to avoid confusion.
2D CAD systems most often only provide one view (from top) and most often only provide for one substrate.
Discrete <b>component</b>s are considered 'mounted' on top and bottom of the substrate.  Permitting the substrate itself
to be mirrored would significantly increase the challenge for exchange validation without attendant economic benefit.
If more complex design (i.e., multiple stacked substrates with complex orientation) is required, 
it is recommended to use the three dimensional capabilities of this part of ISO 10303.

</p><note>
Roundoff may occur.  However, if the scale is significantly variant from 1.0 a receiving system may declare an error.
For purposes of this rule an error of 0.1% is chosen since most systems are significantly more precise.
</note>
</ext_description>
<ext_description linkend="Physical_unit_2d_design_view_arm.Component_2d_location.wr:IP1">
<p>
Mirroring shall be only about the local Y axis, which "local Y axis" is defined as 
a): being parallel to the Y axis of the current coordinate system and 
b): intersecting the <express_ref linkend="Elemental_geometric_shape:arm:Elemental_geometric_shape_arm.Cartesian_point"/> which is in the role of translation for this <b>Component_2d_location</b>.
</p>
<example>
A point at (X = 3, Y = 2) would be at (X = -3, Y = 2) after being transformed using the <b>Component_2d_location</b> if no rotation were applied and no translation were applied, but mirroring were applied.
</example>
<note>
Typically the transformation matrix is the result of applying the ordered sequence of "rotate, mirror, translate" operations to an identity matrix.  Placing translate last in the sequence satisfies the requirement that mirroring shall be about a local axis.

<ext_description linkend="Physical_unit_2d_design_view_arm.Component_2d_location.wr:IP2">
<p>
The determinant of the transformation matrix shall have a value of -1.0 or +1.0.
</p>
<note>
In a received file the value of the determinant may not be exactly 1.0 or -1.0 due to roundoff error. 
Since these are the only two allowed values, standard techniques to deal with the error are easily applied.
