		The seating plane provides no information about the surfaces of the interconnect other than the specific surface being simulated.
		The determination of the instance relationship between a seating plane and the interconnect surface is accomplished by 
		examining the assembly model to identify a mounting surface and then querying the components that are to be mounted on
