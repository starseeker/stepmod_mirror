		The main use of this concept is to support the identification of the connector in an assembly design view that 
		is related to a connector in a usage view for that assembly.  In many cases the reference designator for the usage view 
		is different than that of the design view, and the full details of the connector in the usage view may not be provided.  
		In many cases, the product is not the same product as well, if there are multiple levels of assembly between the design view 
		at which the connector is installed and the product at which the connector is made visible for interface purposes. 
	</note>
	<example>
		A connector in a PCA assembly may be J1 in that assembly.  The unit in which the PCA is a low level subassembly 
		(with a partial reference designation itself of A1A3A4) may have an access hole in the cover which makes the connector
		 directly visible and may have identification of that connector at the product level of J12.  In this case the design organization 
		 would know that A1A3A4J1 was represented at the unit level as J12.

	Multiple shape models may reference the same <b>Part_design_view</b>.  When multiple shape models reference the same <b>Part_design_view</b>,
	the individual shape models have different purposes in the design process.  Multiple shape models may reference one <b>Part_design_view</b>

</p>
<note number="1">
	The decision of how much detail to incorporate in a design view is dependent on the enterprise process, in particular in the case of

	and additional contextual information inherited from <express_ref linkend="Product_view_definition:arm:Product_view_definition_arm.Product_view_definition"/> 
	such as view definition contexts. Pre-processors intended to support analysis may be required to extract partial data when complete data sets would
	overwhelm analysis applications.  Pre-processors intended to support supply chains may be required to convert design intent information into a form
	less suitable for reverse engineering of the design model.  The additional contextual information is not available in CAD layout systems but will
	need to be provided by other input to the Pre-processor.
