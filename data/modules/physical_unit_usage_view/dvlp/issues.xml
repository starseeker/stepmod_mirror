What reference justifies the inclusion of item_definition_structure_arm in this module?

Looking purely to this module - item_definition_structure_arm is not needed here. Remving this USE FROM immediately causes 30 compilation errors,
because USE FROMs are optimized and one removal causes many missing links.
It looks like best is to move this use from to Physical_unit_design_view. In such a way we do minimal change and keep things compilable.
I commit change as proposed by me. Move to bugzilla

In order to have things compilable and avoid possible problems - I restored USE FROM to item_definition_structure.

2 rules in mim EXPRESS promissory_usage_relationship_constraint and promissory_usage_relationship_unique_constraint 
are most likely wrongly placed in this module. They use Physical_unit defined in this module and that is ok.
But they also use promissory_usage_occurrence, which is questionable here.
