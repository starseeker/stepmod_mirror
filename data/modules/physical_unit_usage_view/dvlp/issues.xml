What reference justifies the inclusion of item_definition_structure_arm in this module?

Looking purely to this module - item_definition_structure_arm is not needed here. Remving this USE FROM immediately causes 30 compilation errors,
because USE FROMs are optimized and one removal causes many missing links.
It looks like best is to move this use from to Physical_unit_design_view. In such a way we do minimal change and keep things compilable.
I commit change as proposed by me.
