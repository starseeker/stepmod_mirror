    in AP214 External_library_reference identifies an entry in an external
    library and is mapped onto externally_defined_class (for the class relevant
    case). 
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not understand why you extend in Plib_class_reference the type
    class_source_select (which contains external_class_library) with
    Plib_class_reference: one entity identifies a library and the other a
    class. 
  </p>
  <p>
    What is needed is: Select(External_class, Plib_class_reference)
  </p>

  The intent with the plib_class_reference module was to enable the
  classification of something as a PLIB class.

  My difficulty with what is in Ap214 is that there is no distinction
  between the identification of a class and a library that contains the
  class.

  I understand that Plib_class_reference (which I copied directly from
  AP214) actually identifies the class and the library that contains the
  class through the supplier_bsu attribute.

  I focussed on the library aspect rather than the class aspect, hence the
  extension of the select class_source_select.
  
  I think that you are correct in your observation; however, I'm not sure
  that I agree with the solution.

  It seems to me that if that Plib_class_reference identifies a class as
  external_class does, then the issue is how to classify something as a plib
  class as defined by Plib_class_reference.

  I think that there are two solutions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make Plib_class_reference a subtype of class. That way classification
      module will enable something to be classified as a Plib class. The issue
      here is what to do with the id, name and description attributes of Class.
  </li>

  <li>
    Change the classification module to use an extensible select through
    which classification refers to the class. This select can then be extended
    with  Plib_class_reference.
  </li>
  </ul>
E.g
  <screen>
   TYPE class_select = EXTENSIBLE SELECT (class);
   END_TYPE;
 
   ENTITY Classification;      
      classified : classified_select;      
      classifier : class_select;
   END_ENTITY;
 
   ENTITY Complete_membership;
      containing_set : class_select;
      members : SET [1 : ?] OF classified_select;
   END_ENTITY;
  </screen>
 
I think that this is my preferred option.
Either way, I intend to delete class_source_select in external_class.

The problem is in fact the error checking software, however the mapping has been changed to
make the intent clearer and avoid the error messsage.
