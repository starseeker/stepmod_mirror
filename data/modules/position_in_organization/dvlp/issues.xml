	  It would be good here to describe what a position is. May be add an example. The intro is informative and therefore
	  represents the one chance to be less formal. Suggest you add a second paragraph that does this. 
	  (No need to use the example tag here!)

	  Better to allow for a general relationship. Direct_supervision is one special case.

	  I would suggest making the person attribute point at either a person or a person and organization. 
	  Add a select type to do this and use Person_in_organization as well as Person.

	  0) You do not really define the entity. It is the existence of a person in a position. 
	  (in fact it is a relationship and could have effectivity/times/dates/approvals applied to it)
	  1) Despite the fame of Bill Gates, ISO would not accept the use of real people (unless dead?) in examples.
	  2) Move the example into an example tag.
	  3) The note says "NOTE    There can be max. 1 effective person_in_position for one position. "
	  Please do no use such short hand as max. However the model only allows for
	  more than one person to occupy a position over time or at the same time. 
	  You would have to add a rule to prevent more than one person at the same time. However, until date_time_assignments
	  have been imported (in a higher level module) you cannot write this rule here using EXPRESS.
	  You could add an Informal proposition. However I would instead suggest deleting the Note. 
	  There are such things as job-shares that could have 2 people in the same position at the same time.

	  1) In "A group collecting people in their positions
	  to cooperate in a mutually beneficial outcome without formal supervision relationships." 
	  the section on mutual benefit is not necessarily true. so delete. I am not sure whether the existence of a group 
	  necessarily implies no formal supervision relationships. They may exist between members of the group
	  but are not in the context of the group. Not sure how to explain this!
	  
	  2) Move the example into an example element.

	  1) In "A position type is a recognized kind of position. It enables a person to be assigned to tasks." 
	  delete second sentence.
	  2) Move the examples into an example element.
	  3) Expand out CEO.
