<ext_description linkend="Probability_arm.Probability_by_name">
A <b>Probability_by_name</b> is a type of <b>Probability</b> whose value belongs to a one of a set of named classes,
rather than by assigning a specific numerical value, which may not be available. 
<example> A safety assessment methodology classes the probability an accident as "very unlikely", "unlikely", "significantly likely" and
"almost certain". Any process that has a "very likely" or "almost certain" chance of causing serious injury is shut down. </example>

A <b>Probability_derivation_parameter</b> is a type of <b>Numerical_item_with_global_unit</b> that is a value used by a <b>Probability_derivation</b> in a particular role in
order to calculate the particular probability.
<example> In a coin tossing trial, the probability calculated is that of getting more than 6 heads
in ten tosses. The parameter with the role "at least [parameter_value] heads" will have the
value "6" </example>
<note number = "1"> The role name is given by the 'name' attribute inherited from Representation_item, and the set of such names and their interpretation is defined through reference data.</note>

the distibution, and not those which characterise the distribution. For example, in the case of coin tossing,
the distribution is a Binomial distribution, with parameters of 'probability for a single toss', and
'number of tosses', whereas the parameter for the <b>Probability_derived</b> will be the 'number of heads
obtained'. </note>
