<b>Probability_derivation</b> links the <b>Probability_numeric.value</b> to the 
source it derives from and any <b>parmaters</b> used to derive the value.
<example> A probability of "0.67" is derived from a Normal (or Gaussian) distribution 
using the parameter "plus or minus '1.0' standard deviations from the mean" </example>

<b>Probability_by_name</b> allows the value of probability to be one of a set of named values of probability
rather than assigning a specific numerical value, which may not be available.
<example> A safety assessment methodology classes the probability an accident as "very unlikely", "unlikely", "significantly likely" and
"almost certain". Any process that has a "very likely" or "almost certain" chance of causing serious injury is shut down. </example>
