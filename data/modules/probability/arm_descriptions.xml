<b>Probability_derivation</b> links the <b>Probability_numeric.value</b> to the 
source it derives from and any <b>parmaters</b> used to derive the value.
<example> A probability of "0.67" is derived from a Normal (or Gaussian) distribution 
using the parameter "plus or minus '1.0' standard deviations from the mean" </example>

<ext_description linkend="Probability_arm.Parameter">
A parameter is a value used by a <b>Probability_derivation</b> in a particular role in
order to calculate the particular probability.
<example> In a coin tossing trial, the probability calculated is that of getting more than 6 heads
in ten tosses. The parameter with the role "at least [parameter_value] heads" will have the
value "6" </example>

"almost certain". Any process that has a "very likely" or "almost certain" chance of causing serious injury is shut down. </example>

A <b>Probability_derived</b> associates a particular value of <b>Probability_numeric</b>

the distibution, and not those which characterise the distribution. For example, in the case of coin tossing,
the distribution is a Binomial distribution, with parameters of probability for a single toss, and
number of tosses, whereas the parameter for the <b>Probability_derived</b> will be the number of heads
obtained. </note>
