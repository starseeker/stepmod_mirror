A <b>Probability_by_name</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="probability:arm:Probability_arm.Probability"/>

 whose value belongs to a one of a set of named classes,
rather than by assigning a specific numerical value, which may not be available. 
<example> A safety assessment methodology classes the probability an accident as "very unlikely", "unlikely", "significantly likely" and
"almost certain". Any process that has a "very likely" or "almost certain" chance of causing serious injury is shut down. </example>
