<p>
Probability is mapped to <b>representation</b>, with the probability_value being given through
a <b>representation_item</b> which in turn uses a <b>measure_value</b> to hold the value.
</p>
<p>
In the case of a <b>Probability_derived</b>, the list of <b>Parameters</b> is provided through
a second <b>representation_item</b>, which is structured as a tree, the root and first level nodes of which
are <b>compound_representation_items</b>. The root item is used to provide the list of <b>Parameters</b>
so each first level node represents a single <b>Paramater</b>. This is a <b>compound_representation_item</b>
which provides a list of the attributes (<b>paramater_value</b> and <b>parameter_role</b>), each of
which is a <b>value_representation_item</b> and uses <b>measure_value</b> to represent the
attribute.
