this is a list of random_variable/function_value pairs, where the value of random variable increases strictly monotonically along the list. It represents a numerical approximation to a probability distribution.
<example number="1"> The distribution is the probability generating function for an unfair dice ((1,0.1), (2,0.166),...,(6,0.23)).
Here each pair represents the value on the face and the probability of it occuring.
The probability of rolling a 1 or a 2 is therefore (0.1 + 0.166). </example>
<example number="2"> The distribution is a cumulative distribution function for the measured length of a component ((2.1, 0.0), (2.2, 0.1), (2.3, 0.6), (2.4, 1.0))
Here each pair represents a length and the probability that the component exceeds that length. The probability that the component
is between 2.2m and 2.3m long is therefore 0.5 (0.6 - 0.1). </example>
<note number ="2">The term "random variable" is used to denote the quantity observed to vary randomly, such as the number of heads in a coin tossing experiment, or the observed length of a component.

A probability distribution relates all possible outcomes of an observation on a given system with the probability of their occuring.
<note number="1"> For a full understanding of probability distribution and the terms used, a textbook on probability theory should be consulted.</note>
<note number="2"> This entity describes a particular probability distribution, rather than the general type of distribution. For example, in
coin tossing experiment, the number of heads that may occur is given by a binomial distribution - that is, a type of distribution, and outside the scope of this module.
This module provides the discription of the distribution of a particular experiment, say, 10 tosses of a particular coin. The actual probability of an outcome, say 6 heads in 10 tosses, is recorded using the probability module.</note>
