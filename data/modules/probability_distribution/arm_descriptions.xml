a list of pairs consisting of a random variable value and the corresponding function value.  This represents a numerical approximation to a probability distribution.<note number="2">the value of random variable increases strictly monotonically along the list. </note>
		<example number="1"> The distribution is the probability generating function for an unfair dice ((1,0.1), (2,0.166),...,(6,0.23)).
Here each pair represents the value on the face and the probability of it occuring.
The probability of rolling a 1 or a 2 is therefore (0.1 + 0.166). </example>

Here each pair represents a length and the probability that the component exceeds that length. The probability that the component
is between 2.2m and 2.3m long is therefore 0.5 (0.6 - 0.1). </example>

information or via a "formula" module. This entity provides the distribution function parameters. The value of the random variable for which the probability
