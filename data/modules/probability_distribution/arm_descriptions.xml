Here each pair represents the value on the face and the probability of it occuring.
The probability of rolling a 1 or a 2 is therefore (0.1 + 0.166). </example>

Here each pair represents a length and the probability that the component exceeds that length. The probability that the component
is between 2.2m and 2.3m long is therefore 0.5 (0.6 - 0.1). </example>
