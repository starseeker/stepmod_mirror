<b>Distribution_by_value</b> provides a numerical definition of a probability distribution as a list of index/value pairs.

<note number="1"> <b>Distribution_by_value</b> is used where there is no named distribution which can be used to identify the distribution, for
example, when the distribution is derived from observation.

The <b>distribution_function</b> identifies the type of function which the index/value list represents.

continuous distributions or the probability generation function for discrete distributions. Each function is identified through reference data.</note>

<ext_description linkend="Probability_distribution_arm.Distribution_by_value.has_values">
<b>Has_values</b> is a list of index/value pairs, where the value of index increases strictly monotonically along the list. It represents a numerical approximation to a probability distribution.
<example number="1"> The distribution is the probability generating function for an unfair dice ((1,0.1), (2,0.166),...,(6,0.23)).
Here each pair represents the value on the face and the probability of it occuring.
The probability of rolling a 1 or a 2 is therefore (0.1 + 0.166). </example>
<example number="2"> The distribution is a cumulative distribution function for the measured length of a component ((2.1, 0.0), (2.2, 0.1), (2.3, 0.6), (2.4, 1.0))
Here each pair represents a length and the probability that the component exceeds that length. The probability that the component
is between 2.2m and 2.3m long is therefore (0.6 - 0.1). </example>

<note number="2">To calculate a value using a paramaterized_distribution it is necessary to know the general distribution function, the value
of the distribution function parameters, and the specific random variable value for which the probability evaluation is required.
The Probability Distribution module does not define the formula for the distribution function, and it is assumed that this is defined externally, either through reference
information or via a "formula" module. This entity provides the distribution function parameters. The value of the random variable for which the probability
is calculated is provided by <express_ref linkend="probability:arm:Probability_arm.Probability_derivation_parameter.parameter_role"/> on the Probability module

A probability distribution relates all possible outcomes of an observation on a given system with the probability of their occuring.
<note number="1"> For a full understanding of probability distribution and the terms used, a textbook on probability theory should be consulted.</note>
<note number="2"> This entity describes a particular probability distribution, rather than the general type of distribution. For example, in
coin tossing experiment, the number of heads that may occur is given by a binomial distribution - that is, a type of distribution, and outside the scope of this module.
This module provides the discription of the distribution of a particular experiment, say, 10 tosses of a particular coin. The actual probability of an outcome, say 6 heads in 10 tosses, is recorded using the probability module.</note>
