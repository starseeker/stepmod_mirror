  Need to constrain the relationships between individual and design to ensure
  that all version and instances share the same product.

   <b>(2) Clause:</b> 10303-1164 4.3.1 Product_as_individual
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(3) Paragraph:</b>

   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
A product_as_individual can't be a subtype of product_version it must be a product by its own. This is because even individual products change over time it is essential that several product_versions are even available for individual products.
It is open if a special subtype of product_version, e.g. product_version_as_individual is needed. However Product_as_planned and Product_as_realized should still be (indirect) subtypes of Product_version.
Note that a product_as_individual, e.g. a house, may have more than one design. There was probably a design when the house was build initially. But when the house get later renovated a totally new or only partial design is made. It is still the same house in 2 (as realized) versions, initial and renovated. Each version may have its independent design, which are not related with each other.</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Make product_as_individual a subtype of product. Add a note saying that the product.id may be used for the serial number of this product. Update the other ARM objects and of this class and the mapping accordingly.
Remove IP1 from 4.3.4 Product_design_to_individual.

   <b>(2) Clause:</b> 10303-1164

 <p>
a) Product_as_individual must be a subtype of product (not of product_version) since it has it's own unique product name and id.
b) Product_as_planed and product_as_realized define specific life-cycle-domains of a product. Consequently they must be subtypes of product_definition_view and map to suptypes of product_definition
c) On the AIM level product_as_indiviual and at least one of its major views must be compatible with physical_instance from AP214
</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
a) Make product_as_individual a subtype of product
b) make product_as_realized and product_as_planed subtypes of product_view_definition. Map "as_realized" and "as_planed" to product_definition_context.life_cycle_contex.
c) change mapping of product_as_individual to ensure that product_category.name = 'physically realized product'
d) make corresponding changes for product_planned_to_realized. E.g. map to product_definition_relationship</p>
