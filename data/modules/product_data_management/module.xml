	<!-- Introduction -->
	<!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
	<purpose>
		<p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of a central, common subset of the data being managed within a product data management (PDM) system. It represents the intersection of requirements and data structures from a range of Application Protocols, all generally within the domains of design and development of discrete electro/mechanical parts and assemblies.
</p>
<p>This part of ISO 10303 is not a specification for the functionality required for the complete scope of all PDM system functionality; that is, it is not the union, but the intersection, of functionality present in the relevant set of Application Protocols. Some functionality important for complete PDM functionality is not represented in this application module, but is covered in other APs. </p>
 
<p>By definition, a PDM system is something that manages data about products. At the central core of PDM information is product identification. A <i>product</i> in ISO 10303 represents the concept of a general managed item within a PDM system. In this part of ISO 10303, the general product concept may be interpreted as either a part or a document.  Thus parts and documents are managed in a consistent fashion. 
</p>

<p>Also central to the functionality of many PDM systems is identification of external files (both digital and physical), their relationship to managed documents, and the association of such files with core product identification. 
</p>

<p>Classification of products is important in a PDM system for information classification and retrieval. This part of ISO 10303 supports the basic type distinction between products that are parts and those that are documents and employs product classification consistently for parts and documents. 

</p>

<p>Product properties are integrally related to the definition of an identified product, and so are also included in the central core PDM information. 
</p>
<p>Various general authorization and organizational data that are related to core product identification play an important role in PDM systems and this part of ISO 10303 supports a number of organizational and management constructs relating to product authorization.
</p>

<p>Product structures are the principle relationships that define assemblies and product configurations. This module details part and document structures and represents configuration identification and effectivity information related to those structures.
</p>

<p>This part of ISO 10303 supports  the documentation of requests and corresponding orders for engineering action in support of change management and representations of contract and project identification.
