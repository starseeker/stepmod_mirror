 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable representation of product information and for the exchange of product data. The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing products throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases, and as a basis for archiving.
   </p>
   <p>
This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of the data that identifies a product group, which collects products that share a common activity.  
   </p>
   <p>
The product group captures references to products that need to be included within a group for a specific purpose.  It specifies the group with:
   </p>

     <ul>
       <li>Identification of the group members;</li>
       <li>Purpose of grouping these products;</li>
       <li>Product group boundary;</li>
     </ul>

 </purpose>

 <!-- Items in scope -->
 <inscope>
   <li>Any group of products that share a common need, such as analysis, production, usage, support activity, support solution;</li>
   <li>Any product view within the product life cycle;</li>
   <li>No implication with respect to common part type, number, owner, assembly is made;</li>
   <li>Nested product groups, specifying a group as a subset of another group;</li>
   <li>Reference to the stakeholder to the group, which triggers the group;</li>
   <li>List of common characteristics which is shared by the members of the group, for instance scheduled for maintenance.</li>
 </inscope>

 <!-- Items out of scope -->
 <outscope>
   <li>Product description itself;</li>
   <li>Support solution;</li>
   <li>Support solution.</li>
 </outscope>
