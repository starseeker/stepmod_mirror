 <p>
Currently both "id" and "name" are mandatory. However it is often the case that some CAD/PDM system holds internally only one string. Then these systems have to invent some random string for the other attribute. This complicates data exchange because the receiving system can not distinguish which attribute is real and which is random.
</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
We strongly propose to have one attribute optional - our choice is to make "name" optional. Consequently "id" must be a non-empty string

 <p>
To be able to distinguish products from each other it is essential that the "id" of products must be unique within some scope, e.g. an exchange file or within a database.
</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Add a unique rule for "id". This may be combined with id-owner.

 </p>
 <p>
For exchange purpose, but also for data integration it is absolutely essential that the owner of the id of a product is always specified. The owner may be a person, an organization or some system.
It must be a requirement for every pre-processor to ensure proper product id and id-owner.</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Add an inverse attribute "id_owner" for a person_organization_assignment in the role "id_owner" to ensure that there is exactly one id-owner specified.

 <p>
It makes no sense to include this artificial entity. From an industrial practises point of view it is also clear that the attribute "products" of product_related_product_category (AIM) is defined in the wrong direction. For compatibility reasons it is not possible to modify the AIM. However for the modular ARM this is possible.
</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Add a new attribute "categories" as a set of 1 to many product categories to product. Update the mapping accordingly.

    The proposed solution is unable to capture further information about the
    product categorization such as who assigned the categorization and when,
    who approved. Note the related comment DE-7 (in product_categorization/dvp/issues.xml)
    has been accepted.
