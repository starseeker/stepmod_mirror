An  <b>Occurrence_placement</b> is the specification of the placement of a <express_ref linkend="Product_occurrence:arm:Product_occurrence_arm.Product_occurrence"/>, which is defined in its own coordinate space, in the coordinate space of a reference physical element. 
<p>The placement is established between a <express_ref linkend="Product_occurrence:arm:Product_occurrence_arm.Single_instance"/> that represents the part occurrence and a <express_ref linkend="Physical_breakdown:arm:Physical_breakdown_arm.Physical_element_definition"/> that specifies a view of a version of the physical element.</p>
