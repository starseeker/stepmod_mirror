<ext_description linkend="Product_placement_arm.Occurrence_placement">
An  <b>Occurrence_placement</b> is the specification of the placement of a product occurrence, which is defined in its own coordinate space, in the coordinate space of a reference physical element. 
<p>The placement is established between a <b>Single_instance</b> that represents the part occurrence and a <b>Physical_element_definition</b> that specifies a view of a version of the physical element.</p>
<p>Only specializations of Occurrence_placement can be instantiated.</p>
</ext_description>

<ext_description linkend="Product_placement_arm.Occurrence_placement.reference_organ">
The <b>Physical_element_definition</b> that represents a view of a version of the physical element.
</ext_description>
<ext_description linkend="Product_placement_arm.Occurrence_placement.reference_geometric_space">
The <b>Geometric_model</b> associated with the reference_organ, in which the placed part occurrence is located.
<p>It shall contain Axis_placement instances associated with each part occurrence located with respect to the reference_organ.
</p>
<note number="1">It may contain additional instances of geometric entities, describing shape aspects relevant in the context of the reference_organ. 
</note>
<example>The Geometric_model associated with a reference_organ 'car engine' may contain Axis_placement instances locating the gear box and the crankshaft and additional geometric information representing the envelope box allowed for the car engine. 
</example>
<p>This <b>Geometric_model</b> shall be:</p>
<ul>
<li>either associated through a <b>Property_representation</b> with an instance of <b>Assigned_property</b> whose described_element attribute refers to the reference_organ and whose name is 'positioning', 
</li>
<li>or associated through a <b>Shape_description_association</b> with an instance of <b>Item_shape</b> whose described_element attribute refers to the reference_organ.
</li>
</ul> 
</ext_description>
<ext_description linkend="Product_placement_arm.Occurrence_placement.positioned_representation">
The <b>Mapping_based_template_instance</b> or the <b>Transformation_based_template_instance</b> that specifies the transformation of 
the geometric model of the shape of the placed part from its reference position to the position of the part occurrence in the 
reference_coordinate_space of the reference_organ.
<note number="2">This transformation shall be an isometry.</note>
<p>The <b>Geometric_model</b> that is referred to, indirectly, by the positioned_representation attribute and which defines the local geometry of the part occurrence shall be associated with the Single_instance through an instance of <b>Shape_description_association</b> and of <b>Item_shape</b>.
