 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
<p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module to record:</p>
<ul>
<li> individual products with their whole-part, connection, containment and
involvement in connection relationships;</li>
<li>a library of classes of product with their whole-part, connection,
containment and involvement in connection relationships;</li>
<li>the classification of an individual product as a member of a class of
product, and the classification of a relationship between individual products
as a member of a class of relationship; and</li>
<li>the specification of the complete membership for a class of product or a
class of relationship between products.</li>
</ul>
 </purpose>
