 <!-- Introduction -->
 <purpose>
<P>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module to record:</P>
<UL>
<LI> individual products with their whole-part, connection, containment and
involvement in connection relationships;</LI>
<LI>a library of classes of product with their whole-part, connection,
containment and involvement in connection relationships;</LI>
<LI>the classification of an individual product as a member of a class of
product, and the classification of a relationship between individual products
as a member of a class of relationship; and</LI>
<LI>the specification of the complete membership for a class of product or a
class of relationship between products.</LI>
</UL>
 </purpose>

 <!-- Items in scope -->
 <inscope>
<LI><P>the existence of an individual product;</P>

<LI><P>a mapping between one class of product and another that indicates the
nature of a whole-part relationship between two individual products;</P>
<P>A mapping between classes of product is a class that has relationships
between individual products as members.</P>

</LI>
<LI><P>a mapping between a class of product and a class of connection of
product that indicates the nature of an involvement of an individual product in
a connection;</P>
</LI>
<LI><P>set theory relationships, such as subset, union and intersection,
between classes of product and between mappings;</P>
</LI>
<LI><P>the classification of an individual product as a member of a class of
product;</P>
</LI>
<LI><P>the classification of a relationship between individual products as a
member of a mapping;</P>

<LI><P>the specification of the complete membership of a class of product or of
a mapping between classes of product.</P>
