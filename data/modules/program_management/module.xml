   <usage_guide>
   
   <p>Systems Engineering involves the system specification and design of the 
   system and all ancillary systems needed over the life cycle of the system. 
   It also involves the planning and management of all this work. The Program_
   management_arm captures the information needed to perform the management 
   work along with issue and risk management
   </p>

   <p>The management information includes the structure of organizations; the 
   mapping of persons to the organization; person skills, experience, and 
   certification; and location information such as building location or e-mail 
   address. It includes basic information about the project such as name, ID, 
   duration, funding, and deliverables. It includes the work breakdown 
   structure that specifies a hierarchy of identified work tasks that shall 
   be performed. Often the work breakdown is refined to more detailed levels 
   and supported with a schedule or plan that details the duration of each 
   task and the human and infrastructure resources assigned to do the work and 
   to track progress. In the course of the work information must be controlled 
   by configuration management and issues and risks that arise must be evaluated for the 
   impact and plans revised to resolve the issues.
   </p>
   
   <p>The total set information is composed of several modules that can be 
   verified by exchange of business information among tools. These are the modules:</p>
   <ul>
   <li><module_ref linkend="Project_management:introduction"/>;</li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="Issue_management:introduction"/>;</li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="Risk_management:introduction"/>. </li>
   </ul>


	<p><b>Extensible type select lists (generic)</b></p>
	
	<p>The problem of creating extensible type lists has proven to be an extreme challenge.
	A publish and subscribe analogy is used to explain the approach used.</p>  

	<p>Schemas enable information modelling capability within a domain. The capabilities are 
	enabled by entities.  Entities use other entities directly as specified attributes or less 
	directly via extensible select types.  The associated extensible select type list can be viewed as a 
	subscription list. The list itself contains all entity names associated with entity concepts 
	that subscribe to the capability offered by the schema containing the entity that uses 
	the extensible type list as an attribute.</p>  

	<p>The complexity of the extensible select type list specification problem stems from the fact that 
	lists are relative to a sub-domain of the domain associated with the schema that defines the 
	extensible type list.</p>

	<p>This creates a list creation problem that is 3 dimensional.  The coordinate axes are:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>domain specified by all USE FROM schemas,</li> 
	<li>extensible select types defined within this domain,</li>
	<li>entities defined within a sub-domain of this domain.</li>   </ul>
	
	<p>To size this, AP233 has about 10 major domains, 1000 entities and 
	100 extensible types.  If one does not apply some organizational logic to the problem this 
	implies a yes/no cognitive decisions space containing 1,000,000 points.</p>
	
	<p>In order to penetrate this problem some logical approach that is both scalable and 
	checkable is required.  In AP233 WD1 all schemas where grouped into high level concept
	groups: program management resource information (pmri), organization structure (os),
	project breakdown (pb). schedule (ss) and work structure (ws).  As AP233 WD2 
	evolved major module restructuring occurred and the ability to group at a more 
	detail level of abstraction was enabled.  </p>

	 <p><b>Extensible type select lists - program management </b></p>

	 <p>The Program management_arm module contains the type extend lists relative to  
	 extensible select types defined within the following modules and those that they inherit:</p>

	 <ul><li>
        <module_ref linkend="Project_management:introduction">
          Project_management_arm</module_ref>
        (ISO 10303-1433);
	</li>

	<li>
        <module_ref linkend="Issue_management:introduction">
          Issue_management_arm</module_ref>
        (ISO 10303-1489);
	</li>

	<li>
        <module_ref linkend="Risk_management:introduction">
          Risk_management_arm</module_ref>
        (ISO 10303-1467);
	</li></ul>
	
	<p>The USE FROM connectivity associated with these module are shown below in 
	Figure 1 the AP233 Concept Map map.</p>
	
	   
   	<figure><title> AP233 Concept Map  </title>
	<img src="AP233_arm_Concept_Map.gif"/>	
	</figure>

	<p>The entities defined within the extensible type lists defined within the Program management_arm
	are associated with the schemas inherited from Project, Risk and Issue management arms</p>
			
	 <p>From the perspective of information cross coupling; the type extend lists 
	 identify within this module specify how project, issues and risk information modeling 
	 concepts are coupled together with program management modelling constructs 
	 within the program management domain to service the needs of AP233.</p>
	 
	 <b>Note:</b> 
	 
	 <p>Entries into the type extend lists stem from two primary needs; namely, 
	 harmonization with STEP AP's relevant to AP233 and satisfaction of AP233 needs.  
	 The first group of extends needed for harmonization are derived from the extend lists 
	 used within the following STEP modules - <b>not used by AP233</b>:</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li>1272 - activity_characterized</li>
	 <li>1280 - required_resource_characterized</li>
	 <li>1281 - resource_item_characterized</li>
	 <li>1282 - resource_management_characterized</li>
	 <li>1283 - resource_as_realized_characterized</li>
	 <li>1285 - work_request_characterized</li>
	 <li>1286 - work_order_characterized</li>
	 <li>1289 - ap239_management_resource_information</li>
	 <li>1292 - ap239_product_definition_information</li>
	 <li>1293 - ap239_part_definition_information</li>
	 <li>1295 - ap239_properties</li>
	 <li>1296 - condition_evaluation_characterized</li>
	 <li>1298 - activity_method_characterized</li>
	 <li>1301 - work_output_characterized</li>
	 <li>1306 - ap239_task_specification_resourced</li>
	 <li>1307 - ap239_work_definition</li>
	 <li>1628 - design_product_data_management</li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 <p>The extends associated with this grouping are all placed in type extend lists 
	 having one of the character strings "pmri", "os", "pb", "ws"
	 or "ss" used the extensible select type's name.</p>
	 
	 <p>The second set of extends provide information coupling capability necessary for 
	 systems engineering.  These where derived from a knowledge of the systems engineering 
	 domain and the definitions of the entities and extensible select types defined within 
	 the modules used within AP233.  These all carry the character string "ap233" within 
	 the extensible select type name. <b>This group of extends needs careful review by the 
	 EXPRESS modelling experts.</b>
