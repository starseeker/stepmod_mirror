 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of relationships between project, product, associated breakdowns and properties</p>
     
     <p>The Project_breakdown_arm is about the identification of a project and product 
     structure, i.e. how a project is defined and a product is assembled, categorized, 
     and version controlled. Some projects and products exist and evolve over many years 
     with many product releases and updates. This arm contains information about the 
     identification of the configuration of a project or product for a given product 
     concept as it evolves over time.</p>
     
     <p>It contains the definition of a project, of its responsible organization and 
     of its planned and actual execution dates. It contains the association of a 
     project to activity and product data, and the relationships among projects. It 
     contains the information to identify a planned product or an actual product.</p>
     
     <p>The Project_breakdown_arm contains the information that identifies a product 
     or a product version and the inclusion of a product or product version in a product 
     category. It contains the characterization of a version of a product, suitable for 
     one or more application domains and one or more life-cycle stages. It contains the 
     context-dependent relationship among product definitions such as the fact that one or 
     more versions of products are used in another product.</p>
     
     <p>The Project_breakdown_arm contains the identification of a hierarchical breakdown 
     of a product and the identification of the elements that comprise a breakdown. It 
     includes the identification of parent-child relationships between breakdown elements, 
     and the identification of relationships between elements in different breakdowns.</p>
     
     <p>It contains the identification of a kind of product from user requirements. 
     It contains identification of a set of products grouped together for a common purpose, 
     such  as sales/marketing, analysis, production, usage, support activity,  support 
     solution and disposal It contains the reference to the stakeholder for the group, who 
     causes the  creation of the group, along with the identification of a group as a subset 
     of another group. It contains the list of common characteristics which is shared by the 
     members of the  group, such as scheduled for maintenance, sales, upgrading.</p>
     
     <p>It contains the identification of project and product information selected for 
     configuration management activities.</p>
