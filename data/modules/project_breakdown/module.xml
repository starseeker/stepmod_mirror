 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of relationships between project, product, associated high level 
     breakdowns and properties.</p>

     <p>The Project_breakdown_arm is about the identification of a project and product 
     structure, i.e. how a project is defined and a product is assembled, categorized, 
     and version controlled. It is not about the identification of configuration items .</p>
          
     <p>The Project_breakdown_arm contains the information that identifies a product 
     or a product version and the inclusion of a product or product version in a product 
     category. It contains the characterization of a version of a product, suitable for 
     one or more application domains and one or more life-cycle stages. It contains the 
     context-dependent relationship among product definitions such as the fact that one or 
     more versions of products are used in another product.</p>
     
     <p>The Project_breakdown_arm contains the identification of a hierarchical breakdown 
     of a product and the identification of the elements that comprise a breakdown. It 
     includes the identification of parent-child relationships between breakdown elements, 
     and the identification of relationships between elements in different breakdowns.</p>
     
     <p>It contains identification of a kind of product from user requirements and the 
     identification of a set of products grouped together for a common purpose, 
     such  as sales/marketing, analysis, production, usage, support activity,  support 
     solution and disposal.  It contains the reference to the stakeholder for the group, who 
     causes the  creation of the group, along with the identification of a group as a subset 
     of another group. It contains the list of common characteristics which is shared by the 
     members of the  group, such as scheduled for maintenance, sales, upgrading.</p>
     
     <p>It contains the identification of project and product information selected for 
     configuration management activities.</p>
