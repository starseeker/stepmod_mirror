 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of organizational, project, product, schedule and 
     work data consistent with the systems engineering needs of project 
     management.
   </p>
   
   <p>Systems Engineering involves the system specification and design of the 
   system and all ancillary systems needed over the life cycle of the system. 
   It also involves the planning and management of all this work. The Project_
   management_arm captures the information needed to perform the management 
   work. It is often necessary to share this information among different 
   tools because the organization has not adopted a single set, because 
   consortium of organizations with different tools are involved, or because 
   suppliers and their contracting customers in the supplier network use 
   different tools.
   </p>
  
   <p>The management information includes the structure of organizations; the 
   mapping of persons to the organization; person skills, experience, and 
   certification; and location information such as building location or e-mail 
   address. It includes basic information about the project such as name, ID, 
   duration, funding, and deliverables. It includes the work breakdown 
   structure that specifies a hierarchy of identified work tasks that shall 
   be performed. Often the work breakdown is refined to more detailed levels 
   and supported with a schedule or plan that details the duration of each 
   task and the human and infrastructure resources assigned to do the work and 
   to track progress. In the course of the work information must be controlled 
   by configuration management and issues that arise must be evaluated for the 
   impact and plans revised to resolve the issues.
   </p>
   
   <p>The total set information is composed of several modules that can be 
   verified by exchange of business information among tools. These are the modules:</p>
   <ul>
   <li><module_ref linkend="organization_structure:introduction"/>;</li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="project_breakdown:introduction"/>;</li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="schedule:introduction"/>; </li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="work_structure:introduction"/>; </li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="project_management_resource_information:introduction"/>. </li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>There are numerous relationships among information items in the different modules. 
   These interconnection relationships are accumulated in the several connector 
   modules.These are the modules:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>
   <module_ref linkend="project_management_organization_structure_connector:introduction"/>; </li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="project_management_project_breakdown_connector:introduction"/>; </li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="project_management_schedule_connector:introduction"/>; </li>
   <li><module_ref linkend="project_management_work_structure_connector:introduction"/>; </li> 
   <li><module_ref linkend="project_management_project_management_resource_information_connector:introduction"/>. </li>
   </ul>

   <note>Editorial - Generalize so that this can be used beyond system engineering.
