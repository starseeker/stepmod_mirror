 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of the assignment of certification, classification, 
     contract, timing, documentation, effectivity, justification and 
     security data to product and activity data.</p>

   <p>The Project_management_resource_information_arm contains information entities that 
   are used in many of the other arms. They are collected here as a resource for project 
   management as a whole. They include items like time, classification, conditions, 
   external sources, documents, effectivity, and validity. </p>

   <p>It contains definition of a date according to the Gregorian calendar, definition 
   of a point in time in a day, time offset from UTC, identification of a time interval, 
   and representation of a relationship between two time intervals. It associates a time 
   interval with product or activity data. </p>
 
   <p>It contains the assignment of classification information to product or activity data. </p>

   <p>It contains conditions specified by a textual description with a logical result, 
   and supports use of external entities as input to a condition expression It contains 
   condition assignment, and condition relationships. </p>

   <p>It contains the identification of a document and the identification of a version 
   of a document in both digital and physical forms. It contains document location and 
   document relationships. </p>

   <p>Both activities and products may be valid only for a period of time or in a 
   particular context. This arm contains the identification of a domain of validity for 
   other entities. This may be represented as an interval of serial numbers, an interval 
   of time, or as a batch lot of product. It contains the definition of a relationship 
   between two validity domains. </p>

   <p>Often products, versions of product, line replaceable units, manufacturing 
   procedures, or repair procedures are applicable only under specific conditions 
   represented by effectivity. This arm contains effectivity and its application to 
   product or activity data. </p>

   <p>This arm contains the identification of external sources for a particular item or activity. 
   It contains the association of an item to an external source where it can be provided. </p>
 
      <note>Issue: Contract_arm, Document_assignment_arm, Justification_arm, and 
   Security_classification_arm are redundant with arms in Work_structure_arm. 
   Why should the same modules appear more than once in our module sets? 
   Certification_arm, and Location_arm appear in Organization_structure_arm. </note>
   <note>I have written the introduction without including the in scope statements of 
   these redundant modules since they are described in the introduction to WS-arm and 
   OS-arm.</note>
