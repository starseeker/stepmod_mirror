   <ext_description linkend="Property_assignment_arm.property_assignment_select">
The property_assignment_select is an extensible list of alternate data types. It provides a mechanism to 
refer to one of the listed types.
<note>
Extensions of this Select type, primarily designed to specify the list of entity data types to which properties can be assigned,
are constrained by the existence of resource entities to represent in the MIM schema such an assignment and by the semantics of these entity data types.
For example:
<li>
assignment of properties to activity related data types is represented with the resource entity action_property and is dealt with by module <b>Process_property_assignment</b>.
</li>
<li>
data types that are subtypes of entity data types <b>Representation</b> and <b>Representation_item</b> shall not be added in any extension of this Select type, 
as they provide elements of representation of a property and are not expected to have properties.
</li>
