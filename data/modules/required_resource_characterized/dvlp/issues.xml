Add the entity Required_resource_assignment to
required_resource_characterized_resource_select so that properties such as
cost can be applied to the use of the required resource.

Support for multiple languages is required. So USE FROM Multi_linguism and
extend the string_select select.
The mapping to Language_indication and Attribute_translation_assignment
will have to be extended.

Documented_element_select does not include required_resource. Need to be
able to provide documentation for a required resource.

I would like to reject this with the motivation that a
document can be assigned to the resource_item that is being assigned.
I can't see any reason to assign a document to the required_resource 
(which basically is an assignment of a resource_item to a ...).

  <p>
For required resources we sometimes have required properties (see example
in the assigning_required_resources capability with the test equipment with
a required accuracy). For every other case in PLCS we assign requirements
when we want to have required properties - i.e. we create instances of
requirement_assignment, requirement, requirement_version, etc. Requirement
is a subtype of product because there is a need to configuration control
requirements. In the case of required resources however, we cannot do this
as the requirement_assignment select does not have
required_resource_by_resource_item in it.  
    </p>
			<p> 
Hence I have just shown properties being assigned in this
capability. However, I am not comfortable with this, as those properties
will be requirements and will effectively slip through the configuration
control net. It also provides endless possibilities for data inconsistency
through the product lifecycle. For example, imagine a system requirements
document that defines supportability requirements - one of which is an
inspection ramp that can lift a 2 tonne road vehicle. This would be
modelled as a system_element (qualified as "required" and e.g. assembled
into a system breakdown called "support solution"). However, when we get
into the support phase, the required_resource_by_resource_item instance
will be used to duplicate the same information originally defined in the
requirements.  
     </p>
			<p>
My recommendation is to go for a consistent approach, where requirement,
requirement_version, etc. are always used to represent required properties
- chances are these properties originated in a requirements management
tool, anyway. But, to do this we need a change to the model to extend the
requirement_assignment select to inclide required_resource_by_resource_item
(and any other resource entities the PLCS modellers deem fit to include).

The select required_resource_requirement_assignment_item in 
ISO/TS 10303-1280 Required resource characterized
should be extended to include required_resource (the supertype 
of required_resource_by_specification and
Required_resource_by_resource_item)
