Add the entity Required_resource_assignment to
required_resource_characterized_resource_select so that properties such as
cost can be applied to the use of the required resource.

Support for multiple languages is required. So USE FROM Multi_linguism and
extend the string_select select.
The mapping to Language_indication and Attribute_translation_assignment
will have to be extended.

Documented_element_select does not include required_resource. Need to be
able to provide documentation for a required resource.

I would like to reject this with the motivation that a
document can be assigned to the resource_item that is being assigned.
I can't see any reason to assign a document to the required_resource 
(which basically is an assignment of a resource_item to a ...).
