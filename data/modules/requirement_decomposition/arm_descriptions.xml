An <b>Inspection_requirement_occurrence</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Unknown:arm:Unknown_arm.Ee_requirement_occurrence"/> that specifies a production 
inspection related requirement.  
An <b>Inspection_requirement_occurrence</b> may be a <express_ref linkend="Fabrication_requirement:arm:Fabrication_requirement_arm.Layout_line_width_tolerance_requirement_occurrence"/> or 
a <express_ref linkend="Fabrication_requirement:arm:Fabrication_requirement_arm.Layout_land_width_tolerance_requirement_occurrence"/> or 
a <express_ref linkend="Fabrication_requirement:arm:Fabrication_requirement_arm.Fabrication_thickness_requirement_occurrence"/>.

<ext_description linkend="Requirement_decomposition_arm.Constraint_occurrence">


A <b>Constraint_occurrence</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Unknown:arm:Unknown_arm.Ee_requirement_occurrence"/> that limits possible solutions to the requirements specification by identifying boundary conditions for any potential solution.
A <b>Constraint_occurrence</b> may be a <express_ref linkend="Requirement_decomposition:arm:Requirement_decomposition_arm.Ee_product_definition_based_constraint_occurrence"/>.
<note>
A constraint is simply a logical relation among several unknowns (or variables), each taking a value in a given domain. A constraint thus restricts the possible values that variables can take, it represents some partial information about the variables of interest. For instance, "the circle is inside the square" relates two objects without precisely specifying their positions, i.e., their coordinates. Now, one may move the square or the circle and he or she is still able to maintain the relation between these two objects. Also, one may want to add other object, say triangle, and introduce another constraint, say "square is to the left of the triangle". From the user (human) point of view, everything remains absolutely transparent.

Constraints naturally enjoy several interesting properties:

    * constraints may specify partial information, i.e., constraint need not uniquely specify the values of its variables,
    * constraints are non-directional, typically a constraint on (say) two variables X, Y can be used to infer a constraint on X given a constraint on Y and vice versa,
    * constraints are declarative, i.e., they specify what relationship must hold without specifying a computational procedure to enforce that relationship,
    * constraints are additive, i.e., the order of imposition of constraints does not matter, all that matters at the end is that the conjunction of constraints is in effect,
    * constraints are rarely independent, typicaly constraints in the constraint store share variables. 

Constraints arise naturally in most areas of human endeavor. The three angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, the sum of the currents floating into a node must equal zero, the position of the scroller in the window scrollbar must reflect the visible part of the underlying document, these are some examples of constraints which appear in the real world. Thus, constraints are a natural medium for people to express problems in many fields.
