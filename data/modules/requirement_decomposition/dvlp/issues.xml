  References to Requirements_group_occurrence could not be resolved, I can't find any place that
  entity is defined in a module at this time. This probably needs some work to harmonize
  with the pending AP233 view of requirements.

Requirement_group_occurrence is not in the model.  The documentation needs to be updated.

<p>There is no possibility for the structure as defined to actually represent the application of an operation to the two operands since there is no possibility for the result to be referenced.</p>
<p>proposal:  Make Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship a subtype of Requirement_view_definition.</p>
<p>Then the result of the operation would be a subtype of the operand and that would allow it to be easily added to the Requirement_collection_relationship.</p>
<p>  ENTITY Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship</p>
<p>SUBTYPE OF (Requirement_view_definition);</p>               
      <p>relationship_type               : relationship_operation;</p>
<p>      relating_requirement_occurrence : requirement_view_definition;</p>
      <p>related_requirement_occurrence  : requirement_view_definition;</p>
<p>    WHERE</p>
      <p>WR1 : relating_requirement_occurrence :&lt;&gt;: related_requirement_occurrence;</p>
<p>      WR2: SELF :&lt;&gt;: relating...</p>
<p>      WR3: SELF :&lt;&gt;: related...</p>
<p>  END_ENTITY; -- operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship</p>

<p>(two new rules added)</p>
<p>The mapping would be to an AP210 entity: operational_requirement_occurence_relationship, which would be a subtype of product_definition and product_definition_relationship.

  <description>
Whith the change proposed in issue TRT-1, it is no longer valid for one of the relationship types to be derived from.  If derived from is still needed in this module, it needs to be a separate Requirement_view_definition_relationship subtype itself, since the operation relationship is now actually a representation of an operation and derived from is not an operation.
