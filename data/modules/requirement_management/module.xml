	<purpose>
		<p>
			This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the representation of date and time, approval, identification, person and organization, contract, security, and language data; and the assignment of those data to requirements, requirement definitions, requirement versions, relationships between requirement versions, sources, relationships between requirement collections, requirement tracing relationships, and  requirement assignments.

		</p>
		<p>
			This part of ISO 10303 uses other application modules that relate to requirements and that represent: relationships between requirements the and items to which they are assigned; relationships between requirements and the items that are their source; the data that identify requirements and versions of requirements; characterization views of requrirement versions; and relationships between requirement definitions .

				<p>
         This unit of functionality provides for the representation of requirement
         management information. It includes information for identification of
         requirements, versions and views of requirements, information about
         persons and dates, and information resulting from release and
         approval processes.
       </p>
				<p>
         Additionally, this unit of functionality provides for the 
	representation of descriptive information about requirements expressed in different
         languages and for the assignment of alias identifiers to requirements.
