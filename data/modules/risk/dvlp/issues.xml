	  The definition is very unclear: Is the Risk a likelihood or is it the thing that might occur (i.e. a potential activity).

Propose to use following from ISO Guide 73 Risk Management Vocabulary, Guidelines for use in Standards, where risk is defined as the "combination of the probability of an event and its consequence."  And if so, should the source of origin for the risk be an event and event only?

	  The use of 2 extensible selects based on organization_or_person_in_organization_item with different names is not necessary. Instead this distinction is made by means of the role attribute of the assignment entity. How many other roles could there be for people related to risk??

<description>
The risk_item select includes event_item. Event_item is declared in
Event_assignment module, not Event module. The relevant USE FROM should be
changed.
Is the model intended to say that Applied_risk_probability is applied to
everything that an Event is assigned to?

<description>
 This has been corrected by extending event_item to risk_item.  
 It may be better to subtype event_item as risk_event_item, however
 this would exclude any non-event risk_item.

The initial criteria selects should be made available along with any
mitigated item.  This allows comparison and determine if there have been
realized improvements in overall risk.  By being able to compare, a new
risk treament approach can be selected and another round of reduction
efforts can take place.

it currently stands?
</description>
<comment

   date="2005-10-12">
<description>
No.  Risk_reduction is only needed when something other than risk_acceptance is populated.  By choosing 
the risk_treatment subtype of risk_acceptance, there is no risk_reduction performed.  A new risk_estimation 
may be needed in time which may trigger a different risk_treatment.

In following up - where the actions are followed up and the risks re-evaluated 
based on the outcome of the actions.  When a risk is reduced to a low enough 
level it may be closed.  Sometimes we have so-called sunset risks - these are 
risks that are no longer relevant after a certain date or a certain event.  
Such risks can be closed without action after that date.  Currently, perceived
risks do not have status capability.

<description>
<p>In an early version of the EasyRisk user guide, Risk Profile was simply defined as A risk as a function over time. In a later one, the term is also used for a graph presenting number of identified risk of each risk level for different organisational units at a given point in time.
</p><p>
The term is also used in other contexts, but there is no standard definition. It is commonly used in a conceptual sense to represent the entire portfolio of risks that constitute an enterprise. Some companies represent this portfolio in terms of a cumulative probability distribution (eg, of cumulative earnings) and use it as a base from which to determine the incremental impact (eg, on required capital) of alternative strategies or decisions. For investments e.g. in security funds, it is commonly used for an expression of the funds risk willingness.
</p><p>
With regard to safety, a presentation of estimated risk for a plant or installation, suitable for comparison with established risk acceptance criteria, is often denoted Risk Profile.
</p><p>
The term seems to be used in a lot of different contexts with different meaning, so may it be a bit dangerous for us to try to establish a specific definition?
