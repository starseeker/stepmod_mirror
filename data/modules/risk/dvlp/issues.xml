	  The definition is very unclear: Is the Risk a likelihood or is it the thing that might occur (i.e. a potential activity).

Propose to use following from ISO Guide 73 Risk Management Vocabulary, Guidelines for use in Standards, where risk is defined as the "combination of the probability of an event and its consequence."  And if so, should the source of origin for the risk be an event and event only?

	  The use of 2 extensible selects based on organization_or_person_in_organization_item with different names is not necessary. Instead this distinction is made by means of the role attribute of the assignment entity. How many other roles could there be for people related to risk??

 Removed 'doubling' of selects and added role where applicable.
