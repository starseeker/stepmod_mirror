   <p>
     This module is constructed from several ISO/TS Application 
     modules.  The USE FROM connectivity associated with these modules are 
     shown below in Figures 1 through 7.</p>

	 <b>Note:</b> 
	 
	 <p>Entries into the type extend lists stem from two primary needs; namely, 
	 harmonization with STEP AP's relevant to AP233 and satisfaction of AP233 needs.  
	 The first group of extends needed for harmonization are derived from the extend lists 
	 used within the following STEP modules - <b>not used by AP233</b>:</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li>1272 - activity_characterized</li>
	 <li>1280 - required_resource_characterized</li>
	 <li>1281 - resource_item_characterized</li>
	 <li>1282 - resource_management_characterized</li>
	 <li>1283 - resource_as_realized_characterized</li>
	 <li>1285 - work_request_characterized</li>
	 <li>1286 - work_order_characterized</li>
	 <li>1289 - ap239_management_resource_information</li>
	 <li>1292 - ap239_product_definition_information</li>
	 <li>1293 - ap239_part_definition_information</li>
	 <li>1295 - ap239_properties</li>
	 <li>1296 - condition_evaluation_characterized</li>
	 <li>1298 - activity_method_characterized</li>
	 <li>1301 - work_output_characterized</li>
	 <li>1306 - ap239_task_specification_resourced</li>
	 <li>1307 - ap239_work_definition</li>
	 <li>1628 - design_product_data_management</li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 <p>The extends associated with this grouping are all placed in type extend lists 
	 having one of the character strings "pmri", "os", "pb", "ws"
	 or "ss" used the extensible select type's name.  This module contains only 
	 contributions from this group.</p>
	 
	 <p><b>Problems with Risk module form Phil Spibey, post Funchal 2007 meeting</b></p>
	 
	 <p>Jochen and I made some changes to the Risk resource schema and Risk module last week 
	 which improved the situation.</p>
	 
	 <p>However, there is still a problem with how Risk is modelled which only came to light 
	 when fixing other problems in AP233.  Basically the Risk resource tries to cover all aspects 
	 of Risk, including approvals. This therefore requires the resource part to reference the 
	 Approval MIM, which I believe is not allowed. The recommendation I have is that the risk 
	 resource should deal with the concepts of risk and that is all. Risk approval should be 
	 handled in the risk module, which should then use the risk and approval resources.</p>

	 <p>I realise this means further changes to both the risk module and risk resource, but I 
	 believe it is the right direction to take things. At the present time I have made further 
	 changes to part 58 to allow AP233 to go out for CD ballot, following convenor review. These 
	 changes are not ideal (basically a hack!) to get the EXPRESS to parse correctly, and will 
	 need further work before AP233 progresses further.</p>
 
	 <p>I strongly believe the whole area of risk should have significant ISO and industrial 
	 review. Not because it is wrong, there is a lot of good work in there, but it needs better 
	 integration with the rest of STEP resource parts and current modelling styles in the modules 
	 area. Aspects such as classification, approval, identification etc. are handled in the 
	 resource schema in ways not compatible with AP233, AP239 and others, which seems very 
	 strange since this resource was developed originally to support these standards.</p>
 
	 <p>Since I have worked with this area from the AP233 perspective a number of times now I 
	 may be able to help with the restructuring of Risk_schema, Risk module and Risk_management 
	 module (AP233). However this is dependent on funded AP233 development work which may or 
	 may not be forthcoming.</p>
