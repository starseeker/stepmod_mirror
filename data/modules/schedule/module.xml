 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of a data model that identifies activities, dependencies, 
     durations and milestones associated with products described in a work breakdown structure.  
     This would include the information necessary to produce Workflow Diagrams, Network 
     Schedules, Gantt Charts and Resource Leveling.. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Systems Engineering encompasses the design and specification of systems, 
   the planning and management of the engineering processes that design, manufacture, 
   field, and support for that system. Within organizations and between organizations it 
   is beneficial to be able to exchange plans and schedules. These may be at a high 
   level where they deal with the tasks of work breakdown structure or at low and 
   detailed level where they coordinate individual workers. This module captures 
   information concerning schedules, resource allocation and leveling. This information 
   is needed to manage the life cycle process of developing and using a system such 
   that persons and organizations can coordinate their activities.</p>
   
   <p>This AP233 business case module is constructed from several ISO/TS Application 
   modules.</p>

   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="activity:introduction"/> captures the definition 
   of an activity. An activity is a 
   work element, function or task. It captures the relationship between two activities 
   that might be on sequential, concurrent, or alternative paths. It captures the 
   relationship between an activity and inputs and outputs from the activity, 
   i.e. the product or activity data that it generates or uses.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="activity_as_realized:introduction"/> captures 
   planned or defined activities that 
   will occur in the future. It captures the historical occurrence of an activity and 
   the relationship of the planned activity to the actual historical occurrence of 
   the activity.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="activity_method:introduction"/> captures the 
   identification and description.  It provides a foundation for more detailed and specific 
   specifications of how particular activities are to be performed.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="activity_method_assignment:introduction"/> 
   captures relationships between activity 
   methods. It captures the assignment of activity methods to product data.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="activity_method_implementation:introduction"/> 
   provides the capability to associate 
   additional information with an activity method.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="attribute_classificaton:introduction"/> 
   provides the association of a value, 
   represented by a class, to an attribute of an entity.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="classification_assignment:introduction"/> 
   provides assignment of classification 
   information to product or activity data.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="condition:introduction"/> 
   captures the conditions that impact an activity or its 
   execution. Condition is specified by a textual description with a logical result 
   or by external entities as input to a condition expression. It captures the 
   assignment of conditions to activities and relationships among conditions.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="event:introduction"/> 
   captures the characterization of an event. It captures 
   characterization of a relationship between two events and the characterization 
   of an event with respect to another event.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="management_resource_information:introduction"/>
   provides the:</p>
   <ul>
	<li>faculty to assign management data to product data;</li>
	<li>faculty to assign management data to activity data;</li>
	<li>faculty to assign management data to management data;</li>
	<li>assignment of management data to management data.</li>
	</ul>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="process_property_assignment:introduction"/> 
   captures the specification of a property 
   of an activity, the representation of a property of an activity, or the use of an 
   independent property in the definition of an activity. </p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="property_assignment:introduction"/> 
   provides for the:</p>
   <ul>
	<li>assignment of a property to product data;</li>
	<li>use of an independent property in the definition of an item;</li>
	<li>association of a representation with a property.</li>
	</ul>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="resource_as_realized:introduction"/> 
   captures the recording of resources used or 
   consumed by activities. It captures the usage or consumption of actual resources 
   and types of resource items. It captures the relationship between the resource 
   actually applied and realized with the corresponding resource requirement statements. 
   It captures the relationship between the resource as realized and the corresponding 
   resource events.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="resource_item:introduction"/> 
   captures the definition of a resource and the 
   definition of a grouping of resources as a resource in its own right.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="resource_management:introduction"/> 
   captures the availability of a resource. It 
   captures the planning and recording of resource provision, the allocation and 
   issuing of a resource, and the relationships between allocated resources and 
   the corresponding resource requirements.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="resource_property_assignment:introduction"/> 
   captures the definition of a property 
   that may be associated with a resource or related element. It captures the 
   representation of a property that may be associated with a resource or related 
   element; the use of an independent property in the definition of a resource, 
   and the means to assign a property to a resource or related element. The entity 
   property includes time intervals.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="scheme:introduction"/> 
   captures the identification of schemes that support the 
   ordering of activities. It captures the identification of entries in a scheme, 
   and the association of dates and times with schemes and entries in schemes. It 
   captures the definition of relationships between entries within a scheme, 
   including dependencies and sequencing. It captures the definition of relationships 
   between schemes, and the definition of relationships between scheme entries and 
   schemes that expand on entries.</p>
   <p>The module <module_ref linkend="task_specification:introduction"/> 
   captures the specification of a task as a 
   sequence of instructions encoded as text. It captures the specification of a 
   task as a structured set of instructions. It captures the association of 
   pre-conditions to a task or a stage within a task, the association of post-conditions 
   to a task or a stage within a task, and the assignment of a task.</p>

   <p><b> Re. Scheme - Validation Test Concerns by Lothar Klein</b></p>
   <ul>
   <li>As part of our AP233 evaluation work we are looking on how best to
	implement the Scheme module. We identified a couple of problems
	and think it is best to make several changes for our trial
	implementation:</li>
   <li>This e-mail focuses on changes for Scheme only, but please have in mind
	the neighbouring modules for Task_specification and Activity, Project
	etc. as well. At the end all this has to work in a consistent way.
	I did not list Activity_as_realize here because I think we don't
	need the entities defined there - this is a separate debate.</li>
   <li>Note that the changes listed below shall help to improve data exchange
	and data_integration of different tools. The pre- and post-processor
	may not know from each other - so they may not be aligned up-front.</li>
   <li>The current state of debate on this email tread is being collected and can be downloaded at 
   <a href="http://www.ap233.org/ISO%20references/Scheme%20schedule%20debate.doc"/></li>
