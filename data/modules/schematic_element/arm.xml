<P>A <B>Connection_of_schematic_element_occurrence</B> is a relationship
between two instances of <B>Schematic_element_occurrence</B> that indicates one

<P>A connection of schematic elements means that the juxtaposition of the two
schematic elements on the schematic drawing is intended to indicate that the
things symbolized by the schematic elements are connected.</P>
<note>An application program may deduce the existence of connections between the
things symbolized by schematic elements, such as products or activities, from the existence of connections
between schematic elements. However, the operation of such a program is not
defined by this part of ISO 10303.</note>
<note>An application program may maintain connections between
schematic elements by 'rubber banding' of some schematic elements, when drag
operations are carried out upon other schematic elements. However, the
operation of such a program is not defined by this part of ISO 10303.</note>
