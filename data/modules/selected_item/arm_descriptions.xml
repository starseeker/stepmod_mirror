    A <b>Selected_item</b> is a type of 
    <express_ref linkend="class:arm:Class_arm.Class"/>
    used to classify identified product or activity data as being
    significant for configuration management purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of different classes of selected items are:
  </p>
   <example number="1">
     Time Change/Shelf Life Selected Item (TCSI/SLSI) - All items that
     must be replaced at specific intervals or that have an elapsed time-related
     shelf life, are designated as TCSIs or SLSIs, as appropriate. These items
     do not require the rigorous, up-front CM activity (for example FCA/PCA but
     rather, they concentrate on the post-delivery CM aspects related to
     traceability in the field. This is commensurate with their emphasis on
     being changed/replaced at certain times.
   </example>

   <example number="2">
     Maintenance Selected Item (MSI) - Certain items whose maintenance
     requirements dictate a more detailed traceability than normal items, may be
     designated as MSIs. MSIs emphasize post-delivery traceability for
     maintenance purposes.
   </example>

   <example number="3">
     Support Equipment Selected Item (SESI) - Certain support equipment
     items that require some additional traceability, but do not require
     up-front CM activity are designated as SESIs. These items typically require
     traceability by lot or batch, but not by individual item serial number.
   </example>
