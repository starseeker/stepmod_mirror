A <b>Composite_unit_shape_element</b> is a type of 
<express_ref linkend="Shape_composition:arm:Shape_composition_arm.Composite_shape_element"/> 
that is treated as a unit, as opposed to
as a group of individual 
<express_ref linkend="Shape_property_assignment:arm:Shape_property_assignment_arm.Shape_element"/>.


</p><example number="1">
A <express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Surface_profile_tolerance"/> 
is applied to a square cut-out that goes through a printed circuit board. The square cut-out is a 
<b>Composite_unit_shape_element</b> that consists of the four constituent 
<express_ref linkend="Shape_property_assignment:arm:Shape_property_assignment_arm.Shape_element"/>s 
that correspond to the four surfaces of the cut-out.
</example>
<example number="2">
A <express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Flatness_tolerance"/> may be applied to a
<b>Composite_unit_shape_element</b> to specify that the coplanar surfaces that
make up the <b>Composite_unit_shape_element</b> are required to fall within a
common <express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Tolerance_zone"/>.
</example>


<note>
Common tolerance zones are described in 7.5 of ISO 1101.
