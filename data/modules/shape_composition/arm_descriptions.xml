A <b>Composite_unit_shape_element</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Shape_composition:arm:Shape_composition_arm.Composite_shape_element"/> that is treated as a unit, as opposed to

<example number="1">
A <express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Surface_profile_tolerance"/> is applied to a square cut-out that goes through a printed circuit board. The square cut-out is a <b>Composite_unit_shape_element</b> that consists of the four constituent Shape_elements that correspond to the four surfaces of the cut-out.

<example number="2">
A <express_ref linkend="Geometric_tolerance:arm:Geometric_tolerance_arm.Flatness_tolerance"/> may be applied to a

<note>
Common tolerance zones are described in 7.5 of ISO 1101.
