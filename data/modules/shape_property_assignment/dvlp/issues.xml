The connection between the concept of shape, shape aspects and their 
	associated geometric representations is done incorrectly for the following 
	reasons:
	
	1. Looking at the ARM diagram G.2, the diagram states that a shape is 
	composed of several shape aspects, but is also the representation of multiple 
	geometric_model_representations.  So the diagram is not clear on whether shape 
	is the concept of the property of shape or the representation of shape.  I believe 
	that it was the intent that the shape entity was meant to be the property of 
	shape not the representation.
	
	2. Looking at shape in 4.2.29, it states that the shape is the mathematical 
	"representation" of the form of a part.  A shape_aspect in definition 4.2.30 is a 
	distinct portion of a shape of a part (note: this did not say that a shape_aspect 
	was a representation).
	
	3. Now looking at the assertions, 4.3.28 shape to shape_aspect states that a 
	shape is composed of many shape_aspect objects.  I don't understand how a 
	shape that is a representation can be composed of shape_aspects which are 
	properties and not representations.
	
	4. Furthermore 4.3.27, shape to geometric_model_representation states that a 
	shape represents a geometric_model_representation and a 
	geometric_model_representation represents a shape.  This makes no sense at all. 
	
	How can two different representations represent each other.
	
	It becomes clear from looking at this that the shape entity is being used as a 
	representation and a property at the same time.  I believe that it was the intent 
	of the ARM to say that a shape has several associated shape_aspects and that 
	the shape and shape_aspects have zero or more 
	geometric_model_representation.  In this case shape and shape_aspects are 
	properties and the geometric_model_representation is the means for representing
	 the properties.
	
	This being the case the shape on pg. 80 should be mapped to 
	product_definition_shape and not shape_definition_representation and other 
	appropriate changes made.

SEDS #	262	Convener	WG 03	Date 	1997-04-30	Status	O
	Primary Standard	10303-0203	Primary Clause	5.1
	Author	Valois, John	Team Leader
	Summary/Abstrac
	Problem Description	The mapping of application assertion approval to person_organization requires 
	that a cc_design_person_and_organization_assignment entity be instantiated; 
	this entity requires attributes items (constrained to be a non-empty aggregate) 
	and role (constrained by global rule restrict_person_and_organization_role), but 
	no mapping is provided to populate these attributes.
