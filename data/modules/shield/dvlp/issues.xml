  <description>
Mapping of Physical_shield.shieldable_item most alternative uses mapping path where target instances 
(like component_feature, physical_connectivity_definition) are reached via assembly_component.
this mapping is ambigous. I think it should be written the same way as mapping of similar cases in Integral_shield.
