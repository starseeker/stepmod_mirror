instance of <b>Sketch_2d_representation</b> are required to be two-dimensional. Such an instance may
represent either a set of general curves or the area bounded by a set of non-intersecting closed curves,
the two cases being distinguished by the value of the attribute <express_ref linkend="sketch:arm:Sketch_arm.Sketch_2d_representation.sketch_2d_semantics"/>. In the general
curve case, no specific structural relationships are required between the elements of the sketch.

<note number="1"> An instance of <b>Sketch_2d_representation</b> may be associated with a 
<express_ref linkend="parameterization_and_variational_representation:arm:Parameterization_and_variational_representation_arm.Variational_representation"/>. This permits the association of parameters and constraints with the geometric elements of the sketch.    
</note>
<note number="2"> The semantics of this entity are not fully defined here, the corresponding MIM entity has additional constraints on the geometric elements. </note>
