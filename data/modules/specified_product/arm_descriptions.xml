<ext_description linkend="Specified_product_arm.Product_specification">
A <b>Product_specification</b> is a type of <b>Configuration_watched_item</b> that characterizes a product or a set of products in a <b>Product_class</b> by a set of Specifications.
<note number="1">A <b>Product_specification</b> identifies a manufacturable object, or expected as so.
</note>
A <b>Product_specification</b> is defined with respect to the Product_class it is a member of. 

<note number="2">
The kind of product that is to be manufactured from the data of the Product_specification, 
is the kind of product that the item_concept attribute identifies a class of.
</note>
<note number="3">
The intent of the Product_specification entity is the identification of one manufacturable object whereas the intent of Product_class is the gathering of products with similar characteristics.
</note>

<p>
The actual set of Specification objects for a <b>Product_specification</b> are obtained by the union of the Specification instances grouped in the defining_specifications attribute and 
of the Specification instances related to the considered <b>Product_class</b> through a <b>Class_specification_association</b> or a <b>Class_condition_association</b> with association_type 'identification'.
</p>
<note number="4">The specification of a <b>Product_specification</b> may be incomplete:
there may not be in 'defining_specifications' any instance of Specification for some <b>Specification_category</b> declared as mandatory for the considered Product_class.
For these Specification_category objects, any Specification available in the context of the considered Product_class is considered as valid for the manufacturing of the product characterized by the considered Product_specification.
</note>
<example>If the colour is not specified for a given product family, the specified product resulting from the realization of a <b>Product_specification</b> associated to the <b>Product_class</b> representing the product family may be without paint or painted in any available colour.
