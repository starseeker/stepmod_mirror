	  describes rather than desribes. <br/>
	  However whole definition is weak - it does not really say why it is an And relationship. Change to: The And_state_definition_realtionship is a state_definition_relatioship which asserts that a set of state_definitions all apply.
	  <br/>
	  However writing this makes it clear that the entity lacks context. Which state_definition do they all apply in? (See nks-47).

	  Remove sentence: "This can be a diagnostic process." An entity is never a process! Add a note: Relationships between State_definitions may be used to support fault diagnosis.

	  The several of subtypes of this entity lack context. An Or relationship may only apply in the context of one state_definition but the model does not make it possible to describe the context. Similarly for And and Xor (why is Xor only between two?)
	  It might be better to declare one attribute from State_definition_relationship that points to State_definition and is then renamed. It should act as the parent in all parent-child cases and as the cause in cause-effect cases.
	  In the case of And and OR, it acts as the context(?).

Three entities in question have been made subtypes of State_cause_effect_definition.  Attempting to 
cover the generic cause and effect relationship and then the special cases as from NPDM.
Also, improved descriptions added.

  <description>There needs to be a reference from State_definition to Condition in Condition_arm. 

The definition of states should be expressed as property parameters with Comparison_expression(s) 
indicating their relationship to a given parameter value, such as "greater then" or 
"greater then or equal". These capabilities are provided in the Condition module and should be 
employed by the State_definition. The Condition_evaluation would then provide the capability to 
assert that an object is in such a state.

Will discuss with MVS.  There is a bit of cross-over here with State_observed, I think.  I'm not 
entirely certain that types of state can be expressed as properties and have them compared against 
a condition to exist.  The existence of a type of state or state of definition is just defined, and
all previously identified state definitions can exist and be available for State_observed to call 
them as needed.  The prediction of actuals and observations all happen in State_observed.

  <description>How does one describe an external evironment state of an object? 
An example is that: if a tank is used in "cold weather", then one should do such and such. The "cold weather" is defined as "ambient temperature below 20 degrees Celsius". Suggestion is to subtype State_definition to "Intrinsic_state" and "Extrinsic_state".
