Apply the same style to assignment-entities as is currently in the integrated resources.

As a consequence of this modification in the State IR, the assignment entity 
<express_ref linkend="state_observed:mim:State_observed_mim.applied_state_observed_assignment"/>
was added with <express_ref linkend="state_observed:mim:State_observed_mim.applied_state_observed_assignment.items"/>  
as <express_ref linkend="state_observed:mim:State_observed_mim.state_observed_of_item"/>.

As a consequence of this modification in the State IR and its impact on 
<express_ref linkend="state_observed:arm:State_observed_arm.Applied_state_assignment"/>, 
the mapping had to be updated to reflect this change.

State_observed Module creators should not apply domain specific interpretations to those &quot;over-loaded&quot; words that carry very different meanings across the spectrum of all application domains. State  condition are 2 excellent examples of &quot;overloaded&quot; words	Change AM name from  &quot;State_observed&quot; to &quot;Product_support_ state_observed&quot;

It is the view of the team that the state modules are generic and that
we have not applied domain specific interpretations on the use of the words
satte.  Therefore the issue is rejected.

   <b>SC4 part number:</b>  </p>
 <p>
   <b>(2) Clause:</b> 10303-1256
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(3) Paragraph:</b> 4.3.12
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(5) Comment:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
The state_relationship attributes related and relating are SETs of states. This is very unusual in the overall STEP modeling (see also 10303-41 E.3 Relationship template: object_relationship). The semantic of subtypes of state_relationship becomes by this very questionable. Grouping of states can always be achieved by composition_of_state. We have to avoid redundant mechanisms to achieve things.</p>
 <p>
   <b>(6) Proposal:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
Change attributes related and relating to be of type state (not SET of state).</p>
