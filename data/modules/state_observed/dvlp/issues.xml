As a consequence of this modification in the State IR, the assignment entity 
<express_ref linkend="state_observed:mim:State_observed_mim.applied_state_observed_assignment"/>
was added with <express_ref linkend="state_observed:mim:State_observed_mim.applied_state_observed_assignment.items"/>  
as <express_ref linkend="state_observed:mim:State_observed_mim.state_observed_of_item"/>.
