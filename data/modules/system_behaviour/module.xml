   <p>Behaviour is the dynamic response to excitation of an engineering thing. The emergent properties 
   of the associated response can be either dynamic, what it does in response to excitation, or 
   static, associated with its composition and structure. Behaviour is the subclass of emergent property.
   that includes what it does in response to excitation and excludes static properties.</p>

   <p>Function Based Behaviour and  State Based Behaviour are two different and complimentary views of 
   what a system is to do in response to excitation, (J. Long, 1994). Each has advantages for modeling 
   particular problems and engineers have personal preferences about the two representations. </p>

   <p>State Based Behaviour is a representation of what a system is to do based on descriptions 
   of its relevant characteristics or conditions at particular intervals. What a thing does 
   can be described by citing a set of significant conditions.</p>

   <p>Function Based Behaviour is a representation of what a system is to do based on descriptions 
   of the transformations it performs. What a thing does can be described by citing a set of significant 
   transformations it performs. In science and engineering all changes can be represented by transformations 
   that follow well known transformation laws like conservation of matter and energy.</p>
   
   <p>The AP233 EXPRESS model for system behaviour is very complex.</p>
   
   	<p>The modules used and all of their associated USE FROM relationships for system behaviour representation 
	within AP233 are shown below.  Code 
	yellow implies all USE FROM's are shown for the module identified, Code green implies more 
	USE FROM's exist in the 
	module identified, Code blue identifies the extensible select type defined by the
	module shown.</p>
	
	<p>In Annex F of 
	<express_ref linkend="function_based_behaviour:arm:Function_based_behaviour_arm"/>
	and Annex F of
	<express_ref linkend="state_based_behaviour:arm:State_based_behaviour_arm"/>
	and effort to identify what has been enabled by this EXPRESS model is provided.  No attempt is 
	made therein to provide a mapping between what is enabled vs. enabling elements.

	<p><b>Note:</b></p>
	
	<p>There are no type extends lists placed in this module.  The reason for 
	this is that the modelling paradigms of Function Based and State Based 
	Behaviour are very different and hence are rarely used in a closely coupled 
	manner at the abstraction level of "system behaviour".  All necessary type 
	extends are placed in the respective Function Based and State Based 
	Behaviour modules.</p>
	
	<p><b>Much detail pertaining to the early development of AP233's system behaviour modules</b></p>

	   
   <p>There are two major forms of representing Behavior. Function based behavior,
	independent of state, emerged in systems engineering in the 1970’s. It provides
	for completed functions to enable succeeding functions, for I/O to trigger
	functions, and for ordering operators to represent sequence, branching, and
	iteration. The SEDRES model represents this with a Petrie net model.
	UML 2.0 contributors may be using a Petrie Net model. If so, then these
	two models need careful comparison.</p>

   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall create an ARM (Application Reference Model) consistent 
   with the AP233 Concept Model description of Function Based Behavior</p>
   
   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall support the information unit concept of Function Based Behavior</p>

   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall create a hierarchy for Function Based Behavior.</p>

   <note><b>Definition - function based behavior: </b>A description of behavior based 
   on function and transformation without reference to state</note>

   <p>Behavior is built from Function, I/O (Input/Output), and Function Ordering
	as shown in Figure 3. Any Element may be I/O (Light blue shows an
	entity comes from Figure 1.). A Function is a entity of transformation that
	changes a set of inputs to a set of outputs. Function Ordering orders the
	functions such that it is possible to represent sequence, concurrency,
	branching, and iteration.</p>

   <note><b>Definition - behavior: </b>What an Element is to do or is not to do in 
   response to excitations it receives from the external Elements in its environment.<ol>
	   <li>This is the subclass of property that includes measurable characteristics in 
	   normal use. It encompasses the response of the system to excitation by things in 
	   this environment. In some other engineering disciplines it is the analysis with 
	   differential equations that is called behavior, that is not what is meant here. 
	   Here behavior is a model representation of a functional requirement: what it is to do.</li>
	   <li><b>Example: </b>Make a fender is a behavior with several function steps, 
	   inputs of sheet steel, power, paint primer, and paint and the output of a fender. 
	   Ring is the behavior of a bell or tuning fork. The "Q" of the bell or tuning 
	   fork is a physical property of the bell and its environment.</li>
	   </ol></note>
	   
   <note><b>Definition - Element: </b>That which is discernable by reproducible measurement 
   of its characteristics.<ol>
	   <li>The semantic term Element includes matter, energy and information.  Product 
	   from ISO 10303-Part 1 STEP definitions provide product: a thing or substance produced 
	   by a natural or artificial process. We need to define the informational attributes 
	   associated with the entity named "product" as defined within Product Identification 
	   Module 1017. This entity named "product" has attributes that enable one to capture: 
	   id, name and description.  AM 1017 provides the definition: A Product is the 
	   identification of a product or of a type of product. It is a collector of data 
	   common to all revisions of the Product. Element appears to be a legitimate 
	   subclass of product because AP233 requires reproducible measurement of Element.</li>
	   <li><b>Examples: </b>Any thing from microscopic particles to galaxy clusters is an 
	   Element.  Any thing with a finite existence from galaxies with billion-year lives 
	   to trans-uranic Elements with lifetimes less than nano-seconds. Counter-example: 
	   Things like ghosts, devils, the Loch Ness Monster, the city of Atlantis are not 
	   discernable by reproducible measurement and are excluded. Things under R and D that 
	   do not yet have reproducible measurements and process control are excluded. Silicon 
	   for electronic devices would be excluded in 1900. </li>
	   </ol></note>	   

   <note><b>Definition - function: </b>The entity in the context of modeling that 
   transforms an input set of Elements into a set of output Elements that may be 
   the same or measurably different from the input set.<ol>
	   <li>It is a part of Behavior. This is what functions do in mathematics where 
	   the I/O are variables. In software the I/O is data. In systems engineering the 
	   I/O are Elements, matter, energy, and information. An internal Function is a 
	   kind of function that is allocated to and implemented by System/Structure. An 
	   external function is a kind of function that is allocated to and implemented 
	   by Elements in the Environment. </li>
	   <li><b>Example for systems engineering: </b>The function may be “burn gasses” 
	   with an input of two moles of hydrogen and one mole of oxygen. The output will 
	   be one mole of water, distinctly different from the inputs and a lot of energy. 
	   This function may be followed by a function “cool to 90 degrees centigrade”. 
	   The input had pressure and volume proportional to temperature; the output is 
	   now liquid with a well-defined volume, an isotropic compressibility and a 
	   viscosity. If the next function is “cool to –10 degrees centigrade”, then the 
	   viscosity goes away and the compressibility becomes a fourth rank tensor 
	   relating stress to strain. </li>
	   </ol></note>

   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall support the information unit concept of Function</p><ol>
	<li>shall create a script entity that may be used to capture the detail of what a 
	function is to do. </li>
	<li>shall create a relationship between function and script. </li></ol>

   <note><b>Definition - script: </b>An executable textual language statement assigned to a 
   function to define how that function executes</note>

   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall create a hierarchy for Function</p>	   
	   	   
   <note><b>Definition - input_output: </b>Elements consumed by a function are 
   Inputs and those generated by a function are Outputs. <ol>
	   <li>The name Input/Output or I/O is used because a given I/O entity is generated 
	   by one function and consumed by another. It is a part of Behavior.  In the general 
	   case outputs are different things than inputs, and physical properties, 
	   behaviors, values, variances and probability distributions can all change. In 
	   this general definition “Function” is an Element of type information and cannot 
	   be realized in the physical world except through Elements of type matter or 
	   energy that exhibit that function. In the physical world things transform other 
	   things. It is this fact of reality that results in the allocation of Function 
	   to structure which is really a statement that this particular structure entity 
	   exhibits this particular function and it will be used to provide that transformation. 
	   The thought pattern is to think of the desired transformation, Function, to 
	   consider alternative things that might be used to provide it, and to select among 
	   these, using a trade study based on optimization.</li>
	   <li>I/O may trigger functions and it may terminate functions.</li>
	   </ol></note>
	   
   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall support the information unit concept of Input/Output (I/O)</p><ol>
	   <li>shall create two relationships for each I/O entity: </li>
	   <li>- shall create a <b>consumes</b> relationship to one Function and </li>
	   <li>- shall create a <b>generates</b> relationship to a different Function.</li></ol>

   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall create a hierarchy for Input/Output (I/O)</p>

   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall create an allocation relationship between I/O and Property, 
   where Property is associated with Unit, Value, Tolerance, and Probability Distribution </p><ol>
	   <li>Property allocated to I/O shall be useable as a parameter in the Structure Module 
	   set for purposes of analysis.</li></ol>
		
   <note><b>Definition - function_ordering: </b>Function Ordering imposes how 
   functions execute, which may be sequential, concurrent, traversed iteratively, 
   or lie on separate alternative paths.<ol>
	   <li>It is a part of Behavior. Note that there are several ways to represent function 
	   ordering. It may be done with ordering operators and triggering I/O as in classical 
	   behavior diagrams or it may be done with events, states, and transitions as done 
	   in state machines and state charts. For this fine level of detail it is necessary 
	   to compare the detailed models created in ISO PAS 20542, the concept model and those 
	   emerging from UML 2.0 development.</li>
	   <li><b>Example: </b>A function is activated when all preceeding threads of functions 
	   are complete. At this point the function examines its inputs.  If and only if all triggering 
	   inputs are present the function proceeds to do its work. If one or more triggering 
	   inputs is absent, the function waits for them to begin doing its work. Triggers 
	   that arrive while the functions are running are stored in a FIFO queue. Ordinary 
	   I/O that arrives while a function is deactivated is stored in a LIFO queue. If 
	   the function is running it is discarded.  A function is deactivated when it 
	   completes its work or is deactivated by I/O.</li>
	   </ol></note>

   <p>A model for function Based Behavior is given in Figure 4. I/O may trigger
	functions, starting or terminating functions. I/O that triggers is coupled to the
	function by binding to a Function Control Port. I/O that does not trigger is
	bound to a Regular Function Port. I/O arriving while a function is active is
	stored in a queue unless it is terminating I/O</p>

			<figure><title>   </title>
			<img src="Slide18.gif"/>	</figure>
	
   <p>Function ordering uses a set of operators: AND to define concurrency,
	Multi-exit Function or OR to represent alternative paths, a sequence operator,
	and LOOP, Iterate, and Replicate constructs. LOOP and ITERATE require
	limits to control their termination. Scripts are used to provide detailed control
	of function ordering. Probabilities are assigned to Or Out to facilitate
	execution of the behavior to produce time lines or Monte Carlo simulation.</p>

      <p><b>Concerns, Observations and comments</b></p><ol>
   <li>There are several presentation formats that are "classic" within the systems engineering
   community.  These are all defined with Jim Long's white paper on the subject; Download paper from 
   <a href="http://www.vitechcorp.com/infocenter/papers/CommonGraphicalRepresentations_2002.pdf"/></li>
   <li>Need to provide a neutral data representation of all associated data</li>
   <li>User must be capable of viewing information from the perspective of any classic presentation format.</li>
   <li>Capture this as a series of requirements</li></ol>
    
   <p>Most systems engineers today use graphical representations of a system to communicate 
   its functional and data requirements. The most commonly used representations are the 
   Function Flow Block Diagram (FFBD), Data Flow Diagram (DFD), N2 Chart, IDEF0 Diagram, 
   Use Case, Sequence Diagram, Enhanced Function Flow Block Diagram, and Behavior Diagram.</p>   

   <p>When analyzed in the context of specifying functional control and data modeling, 
   it appears that the FFBD and DFD representations are limiting, special cases of the 
   Enhanced Function Flow Diagram and Behavior Diagram. The N2 Chart has the same 
   capability as the DFD, with a more formal format. The IDEF0 is essentially an N2 
   Chart with some control definition (no constructs) capability. The IDEF0 has the 
   capability to indicate the allocation of functions to system components.</p>   

   <p>Thus, the Enhanced Function Flow Diagram and the Behavior Diagram features 
   comprise a “parent/unified” set of graphical system representations. To achieve 
   the same level of specification completeness, you would have to use an integrated 
   set of the FFBD and one of the data models or augment the FFBD with a graphical 
   representation of the data model, as was done at TRW (then called Function Sequence 
   Diagrams).</p>   
   
   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall non-redundantly record the FBB characterization information 
   associated with all classic FBB presentation formats</p>

   <p><b>Requirement: </b>shall support Data Flow Diagram (DFD) presentation</p>

   <p><b>State based behavior - </b>State based behavior emerged from automata theory and has matured into
	State Charts that provide for state explosion in highly concurrent models.
	SEDRES has a representation for this and has demonstrated model transfer
	between Statemate and Teamwork Real Time tools.</p>

	<p>In the UML community Action Semantics are to provide a basis for
	state based behavior. These two approaches require careful correlation. The
	concept model here does not go beyond the very general notion of function
	ordering, but notes the critical importance of correlation among emerging
	detailed models.  Associated documentation can be obtained via the web site

	<li><b>State Based Behavior Module Set, SBB: </b> This module set supports behavior representations 
	such as Data Flow Diagrams, State Charts, Moore Extended State Machines, and Mealy Extended State 
	Machines. These representations are supported by a group of tool vendors, most of whom are 
	participating in the refinement of UML 1.4 to UML 2.0. It is expected that the tools will become 
	compliant with that standard. In consequence, AP233 will also adopt map to that standard for 
	State Based Behavior. The work to be done is to obtain the standard adopted by OMG for UML 2.0 and 
	to convert it to equivalent EXPRESS modules.  Tools like Statemate Magnum may not be UML 2.O compliant. 
	These type of tools will still have to covered by state based behaviour. </li>
	<li><b>Function Based Behavior Module Set, FBB </b> This module set supports behavior representaitions 
	such as N-Squared Charts, CORE EFFVBD’s (behavior diagrams), Functional Flow Block Diagrams, 
	BAE SYSTEMS CoRE Thread Diagrams, relevant IDEF Diagrams , hierarchy and Scripts.</li>
	<li><b>Exclusions from the FBBBEH Module Sets </b> Engineering design diagrams such as logic diagrams,  
	geometric drawings, petri nets, Truth Tables, activity diagrams analysis equations, and control 
	block diagrams are excluded.   These should be added in additional modules.</li>
	<li><b>Requirement (FBM1): (HPF says covered/implied in above) </b>data model must be able to capture 
	in a semantic form, information that is 
	traditionally represented in various notations currently widely used by systems engineers in this 
	domain which include, but are not limited to: data flow diagrams (and mini specs), Functional Flow Block 
	Diagrams (FFBD), state transition diagrams, statecharts, activity diagrams, N2 charts, IDEF0 diagrams, 
	control engineering block diagrams, pseudocode, the notations of UML1.4 2.0 that in any way capture 
	product functionality and behaviour.</li>
	<li><b>Requirement (FBM2): (HPF says covered/implied in above) </b>shall provide that the semantic content 
	with the source material of a behavioural specification in its native form, when expressed via the 
	FBM SBB or FBB data model, must be re-representable in a way semantically indistinguishable from the 
	original source material, as far as possible. </li>
	<li><b>Requirement (FBM3): (HPF says this is actually a data model presentation ability concern not 
	covered above): </b>, SBB or FBB when used with (a complete) data representation module, is about 
	supporting the movement of 
	behavioural specifications from one engineering tool to another, including the reproduction of the 
	diagrams used to represent such specifications. However, FBM SBB or FBB and the data representation 
	module should make it possible that reproduction of approximate representations (that remain 
	semantically consistent), and that are recognisably similar to the originals, can be produced. It 
	is not expected that the structured diagrams (listed in FBM1) can be reproduced verbatum. For 
	instance, it is not necessary that a Ward-Mellor data flow diagram is reproduced with same font 
	labels, arrow styles, and exact placement (in the way a PDF conversion of a Word document tightly 
	reproduces the original). However, it is important that arrows (representing flows) touch ('connect') 
	circles representing transforms, and that the arrow is indicated in the correct direction to reflect 
	the sense of the flow. It is important that the relative placement of major graphic elements (circles, 
	arrows) are recognisably similar on the generated diagram as on the original.</li>
	<li><b>Requirement (FBM4) : (HPF says covered in above) </b>The module concepts shall be built on 
	existing STEP Modules where possible. </li>
	<li><b>Requirement ??: (Causal chain) </b> Lots of good stuff in Causal Chain Exposed report.  The report can be downloaded at:
	<a href="http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/stepmod/stepmod/etc/ap233/references/system_behavior/Causal_Chain_review.doc?revision=1.1"/>.  Some 
	of this stuff may enable BAE SYSTEMS CoRE Thread Diagrams. These need to define, only Julian can do this.</li>

	<li>Eric Herzog has provided the most complete set of issues for this module set. The team needs 
	to work through them all. </li>
	<li>The weakest part of the FBB module set appears to be the function 
	ordering arm. It is based on the Task specification arm from AP239 that was created to support 
	ordering of activities for scheduling. Two efforts at verification of scheduling have found that 
	it can be used for that purpose. </li>
	<li>Eric suggests that a causal chain representation is far superior 
	for this purpose.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p><b>Notes extracted from Valencia nd Rochester meetings summer 2005</b></p><ul>
	<li>During the discussion period associated with "breakdown" it was agreed to make use of 
	the stepmod breakdown arms.  It was agreed that "functional_breakdown_arm" logically belong 
	with functional based behavior.  Upon reflection USE FROM functional_breakdown_arm belongs 
	at the system_behavior_arm level.</li></ul>
	<note> At the FBB level stepmod's functional breakdown could be confused with the 
	breakdown of FBB "transformation". The difference between these concepts needs to be made clear.</note>
	<ul>
	<li>Re. FBB - Attempts to be made by David O, Phil S, Erik H and Harry F to use the 
	SEDRES Petri net approach.  This will result in a rewrite of the transformation ordering and 
	input_output arms within FBB</li>
	<li>Re. FBB - Debate ready copy to be ready for review at offste.</li>
	<li>Re. FBB - Collect and generate decision criteria for selection of alternative ordering 
	and input_output alternatives. For example:</li></ul>
	<ol>
	<li>Minimize the cost to vendors of implementing interfaces to the standard</li>
	<li>Provide function ordering such that object order is preserved</li>
	<li>Provide a modularity that can be used with other behavior modeling techniques such
  as state charts and state machines</li>
	<li>Achieve harmonization with SysML realization of function based behavior, activity
  diagrams</li>
	<li>Provide rigorous semantics for support of systems engineering tools</li>
	<li>Provide rigorous semantics for interoperability of tools that contain execution engines
  for the transferred data such that the execution results are invariant.</li>
	<li>Provide rigorous semantics for support of interoperability with the tools of as many
   other AP’s as possible</li>
	<li>Select for efficient implementation in terms of data storage and performance time.</li>
	</ol>
	<ul><li>Re. FBB - AP210 has expressed the desire to exchange time lines with AP233 as predictable 
	via executable FBB.  Dan Cox is creating an example to help see through the problem.</li>
	<li>Re. FBB - Decision was made to proceed with Time line work.  At offsite review, decide if this 
	is what AP233 needs.  Decide on what enhancements are needed for AP210 and AP233.</li>
	<li>Re. FBB - Cross check FBB modules with ViTech CORE schema.  3SL folks (Cradle) at the 
	Rochester INCOSE meeting agreed to also supply the Cradle schema.</li>
	</ul>
	<note>Arguments surround "analysis" and where the hand-off between domain and AP233 exists. 
	The exchange of FBB data is valid if and only if the associated time lines derived via independent 
	executables agree.  The testing of executable derived time lines becomes a means for the verification 
	of the FBB information exchange model.</note>
	<ul>
	<li>Re. SBB - To be built from SysML by David P.  Funding is now in place.  Debate ready work should be
	ready for PDES fall offsite.</li></ul>
	<note>This work will need to be cross checked with SEDRES work for missing concepts.</note>
	<ul>
	<li>Re. SELECT Type extends - Use the schema's of Vitech CORE and 3SL Cradle to identify all associated 
	connectivity.  What's in these schema's defines what's essential from a user stakeholder perspective.
	We can then debate if any other connectivity is needed.</li></ul>
