    This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
    representation of the variety of general model classifications used to
    support model-based systems engineering.  This includes all models used to
    characterize the physical structure and its behavior and the full range of
    models used to support system engineering trade studies.

    This module is one of AP233's two top level modules.  Its focus is on the
    variety of modeling paradigms used to represent the physical and functional
    system along capabilites used to support associated verification, validation and
    trade studies. It links to but does not include capabilities that support the
    managment activities of systems engineering.

<p><b>Begin - Notes from SC4 Meeting in Hangzhou and post meeting email exchanges</b></p>
   <p>There is an accepted need and desire to insure that AP233 and SysML work together
     to the greatest degree posssible.  Much of the capability provided via SysML can
     be logically viewed as belonging within the scope of this module.  In a sense, this
     is where SysML meets Configuration Management.  Detail is under development.
   </p>
      
<p><b>Re: "Analysis"</b></p>
   <p>Decision-making is an integral part of any systems engineering activity.
      Decisions are assumed to be rational (what, why, how).  They are  made by people
      and organizations; somewhere, and at some point in time (who, when, where).
      The proposed concept model seeks to provide the basic the network of concepts
      and relationships necessary for the representation and exchange of all computer
      sensible information associated with the systems engineering decision-making process.
      Within this context; "analysis" supports decision making.  An associated concept model
      is available at:.
      <a href="http://www.ap233.org/Concept%20Model/Analysis%20and%20Decision-making/Analysis%20and%20decision%20making%20Draft%20%238-1.pdf"/>.
      This model has been reviewed at several 2005 AP233 meetings.  It is presently under
      more careful in depth review by members of the Vivace Project under the leadership of
      Phil Spiby and Mats Lindeblat.</p>

   <p>It is presently expected that capabilities necessary to enable "analysis"
      representation, within AP233, as it supports system engineering decision making
     will placed in this module.</p>
