A <b>Test_requirement_allocation</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="Requirement_assignment:arm:Requirement_assignment_arm.Requirement_assignment"/> for which the <express_ref linkend="Requirement_decomposition:arm:Requirement_decomposition_arm.Requirement_definition_property"/> has test characteristics. A <b>Test_requirement_allocation</b> is the relationship between the <express_ref linkend="Requirement_decomposition:arm:Requirement_decomposition_arm.Test_requirement_occurrence"/> and the <express_ref linkend="Product_version:arm:Product_version_arm.Product_version"/> to which the requirement is allocated.
The terminals of the product are related to either parametric data in an executable form or to data derived from experimental or theoretical measurements.
</p><note>
The structural split of allocation and requirement occurrence permits re-use of common test requirements and associated procedures over multiple products.

the <b>functional_specification_based_test_access</b> specifies the role of the <express_ref linkend="Part_terminal:arm:Part_terminal_arm.Functional_usage_view_to_part_terminal_assignment"/> for the <b>Test_requirement_allocation</b>.
The <b>functional_specification_based_test_access</b> specifies the mapping of the terminals of the <express_ref linkend="Network_functional_usage_view:arm:Network_functional_usage_view_arm.Functional_unit_usage_view"/> onto the relevant terminals of the product for which the test is specified.
</p><note>
The mapping provides a formal mechanism for associating the details of the required behavior represented as a result of a experiment, as defined by a  <express_ref linkend="Functional_specification:arm:Functional_specification_arm.Functional_specification"/>, with the terminals of the tested product.

The mapping provides a formal mechanism for associating the details of the required behavior represented in computer executable form, as defined in the body of an  <express_ref linkend="Analytical_model:arm:Analytical_model_arm.Analytical_model_definition"/>, with the terminals of the tested product.
