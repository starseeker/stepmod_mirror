The OMG SysML initiative has also developed a model for handling expressions - they call it the "parameter model". AP233 and SysML have agreed to be aligned. However, their model is more general than AP233, because they do not assume that functions have a return value. In other words, they just establish the relationship between parameters. I think AP233 should be able to also do this.
