   <ext_description linkend="Topologically_bounded_surface_arm.Advanced_face">
	 An <b>Advanced_face</b> is a  type of <b>Detailed_geometric_model_element</b> that defines an oriented face.
	 The face is based on a surface and is bounded by edges and vertices.

        <p>The following constraints apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <b>Advanced_face</b> is required to be fully bounded by edge loops or by vertex loops.</li> 
<li>At most one of the bounds of the face may define the outer bound. </li>

      <note>
          For some types of closed or partially closed surfaces, it may not
          be possible to identify a unique outer bound.
        </note>
        
      <example number="1">
          Any edge loop on a plane surface may be used to define a face
          outer bound provided it is not enclosed in any other loop in the
          face. 
        </example>
        
      <example number="2">
          A circular loop on a cylindrical surface cannot define a face
          outer bound since it does not enclose a closed domain in the
          surface.
        </example>

         <li>
            The geometry used in the definition of the face shall be
						restricted. The face geometry shall be an elementary surface, swept
						surface, or b-spline surface.
          </li>

         <li>
            The geometry of all bounding edges of the face shall be fully defined as edge curves.
          </li>

         <li>
            The types of curve used to define the geometry of edges shall be restricted to lines, conics, 
						polylines, surface curves, or b spline curves.
          </li>

         <li>
            All vertices used in the face definition shall be of type vertex point with geometry defined by 
						a cartesian point.
          </li>

         <li>
            The use of oriented paths in the definition of the edge loops of the advanced face is prohibited.
          </li>

         <li>
            If the face geometry is a swept surface then the swept
						curve used in the definition shall be a line, conic, polyline, or a
						b-spline curve. 
          </li>

         <li>
            For any vertex loop used to bound the face, the loop vertex shall be a vertex whose geometry shall be defined by a cartesian point.
          </li>

         <li>
            The face bounds shall be defined by either edge loops or vertex loops.
          </li>

         <li>
            If a surface curve is used as part of a face bound then the associated geometry attribute shall 
						reference pcurves not surfaces.
          </li>

         <li>
            If a polyline is used either to define a swept surface or as part of a face bound, 
						it shall contain at least three points.
          </li>

         <li>
            Any instance of advanced face which has the geometry of a complete spherical surface 
						shall be bounded by a vertex loop located at the point where the z axis of the placement 
						coordinate system leaves the surface of the sphere, (i.e. at the North Pole of the sphere).
          </li>      
      </ul>
