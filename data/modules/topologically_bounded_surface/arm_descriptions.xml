   <ext_description linkend="Topologically_bounded_surface_arm.Advanced_face">
An advanced face is a special type of face surface that has additional
constraints to ensure that the geometry is directly and completely
defined. The advanced face is the top level entity that is used to
formulate the precise meaning of a topologically bounded surface
corresponding to the scope of this module. 
        <p>
An advanced face is required to be fully bounded by edge loops or by vertex
loops. 
        </p>
        
      <p>
          At most one of the bounds of the face may be of type face outer
          bound. 
        </p>
        
      <note>
          For some types of closed or partially closed surfaces, it may not
          be possible to identify a unique outer bound.
        </note>
        
      <example number="1">
          Any edge loop on a plane surface may be used to define a face
          outer bound provided it is not enclosed in any other loop in the
          face. 
        </example>
        
      <example number="2">
          A circular loop on a cylindrical surface cannot define a face
          outer bound since it does not enclose a closed domain in the
          surface.
        </example>
