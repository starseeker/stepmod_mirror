We need to be able to relate type to actual (and the other way round).  e.g. John Smith (person) is a grade 3 welder (type) with 5 years experience (actual).  A grade 3 welder must have at least 3 years experience

During the modelling, the discussion on this topic went something like this ..
 
John Smith is a grade 3 welder - grade 3 welder is a qualification. If you want to assign John Smith to a welding task, you would check that he has the qualification to do the task (i.e. he is grade 3 welder).
 
Grade 3 welder must have at least 3 years experience - grade 3 welder is a type_of_person. A definition of this type of person is that he could have 3 years experience. Another definition could be that he has been to the "university of welding" and has 1 year experience. In the task analysis, you would assign a grade 3 welder as a type_of_person to do a task.
 
The idea of John Smith being classed as a type_of_person was not discussed. No reason why not, but I guess that this would be done at a higher level module.

		<description>
 Type_of_person_classified_select should be extended to include Type_of_person_assignement, so that role can be applied by external class.
 It would also be useful to extend the select to Type_of_person, Type_of_person_definition and Type_of_person_definition_required_attributes_relationship

PLCS needs to be able to classify the Type_of_person,
Type_of_person_definition 
Original cause of comment: Without enabling classification of person, modules do not allow gender to be determined.

Mappings should be provided to all extensible selects, even if they have
been populated in the module.
