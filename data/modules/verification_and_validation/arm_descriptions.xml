A <b>Validation</b> is a subjective assertion that an item is "fit for purpose".  
Evidence used in this validation is identified by the inverse attribute <b>validated_by</b>.

Validation is commonly understood to mean "Have we built the right system?". Validation is concerned with ensuring that the system will meet the customer’s objectives and expectations. Validation usually includes testing under normal usage conditions.

<note>An item may pass validation even though some requirements fail verification.</note>

<note>It is assumed that meta data supporting the validation will be applied using assignment entities, such as identification assignment, person and organization assignment etc..</note>

<example>Every flight of every Space Shuttle has been a "Validation" flight to test the new design under actual conditions. No two shuttles have flown in the same configuration and many systems cannot be validated except under actual conditions.</example>

A <b>Verification</b> is an objective assertion of a claim that requirement is satisfied by a particular item represented in a <express_ref linkend="requirement_assignment:arm:Requirement_assignment_arm.Requirement_satisfied_by"/> has been verified. The evidence used in this verification is identified by the inverse attribute <b>verified_by</b>.

Verification is commonly understood to mean "Have we built the system right?". Verification ensures that the specified requirements have been met. Verification uses the methods of Test, Analysis, Inspection, Demonstration, Similarity.

<note>Just because an item is verified does not ensure that it meets all stakeholder needs or expectations, many of these are never specified are of an un-testable nature e.g. "the car should look sporty".</note>

<note>It is assumed that meta data supporting the verification will be applied using assignment entities, such as identification assignment, person and organization assignment etc..</note>
<example>
A data type used to represent a vehicle's engine with a power output of 160BHP could be asserted to satisfy a requirement "the vehicle shall have a maximum power output of at least 150BHP".  This assertion may be verified by analysis results on simulations of the engine. In this case the analysis results would be identified in the items collection of an evidence instance, possibly including the approval of the analysis. The evidence instance would identify that it is used to support the required verification.
