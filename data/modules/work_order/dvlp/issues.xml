<description>
  The chosen_method attribute is a derived attribute.
  I think that the type should be Activity_method.
  I am not sure that the derivation is correct

The chosen_method attribute is now longer associated with work_order.
Will be in a higher module.

The text definition of Work_order.name is not satisfactory (there is no way
nor requirement to ensure uniqueness). I recommend to replace it by an id
attribute and to use the wording for id attributes in the IRs.

Work_order.in_response_to should be a SET[0:?] of Work_request as some
work_orders may not be associated with any work_request.

The IR does not allow a set 0 - however, there is a SEDS against it.

The entity Work_order and Directed_activity are circular: they each refer
to the other one. 

At least, one of the references have to be replaced by an inverse attribute.
 
Preferably, Work_order.directed_activity should be replaced by:
  <p>
Inverse 
    controlled_activity:SET[1:?] OF Directed_activity as directive;
  </p>

We need a capability to record the "reason" for a change.
Is this the reason that a  version has gone from one version to the next?
Or the justification for the work_order?
