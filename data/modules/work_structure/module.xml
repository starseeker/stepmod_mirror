 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of the pieces of work necessary to complete a project.</p> 

        <p>This AP233 business case module is constructed from several ISO/TS Application 
   modules.  It has, with all associated references satisfied sufficient capability to 
   test, verification and validation all in scope representational statements.</p>

    <p>The Work_structure_arm contains the information necessary to defined the work 
   to be performed. </p>
      
   <p>The Work_structure_arm provides for the identification and characterization of 
   a <module_ref linkend="work_request:introduction"/> and a 
   <module_ref linkend="work_order:introduction"/>. It provides for an association to 
   be made between the work request and the <module_ref linkend="observation:introduction"/> 
   which initiated the work request. It contains an identification of 
   the activities governed by a work order. It defines the hierarchy of tasks to be 
   performed along with required inputs, and deliverable products and information. 
   It contains the definition and quantification of planned as well as completed 
   <module_ref linkend="work_output:introduction"/>.</p>
