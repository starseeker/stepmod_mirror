 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p> This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application module for the
     representation of the pieces of work necessary to complete a project.</p> 
   <p>The Work_structure_arm contains the high level information basic to the work 
   to be performed under contract. A formal legal contract may be present, or it 
   may be informal and represent transfer of information and responsibility among 
   product development teams. The contract is identified along with information 
   associating activity or product data with the contract. The Work_structure_arm 
   contains approval information, identification and status, associated with the 
   contract, the product, and work activities. It defines the hierarchy of tasks 
   to be performed along with required inputs and deliverable information or products. 
   It contains the definition and quantification of planned as well as completed 
   work outputs.</p> 
   <p>The Work_structure_arm contains the identification and characterization of 
   a work request and a work order. It contains identification of the activities 
   that are governed by a work order.</p> 
   <p>The work_structure_arm contains the definition of a security classification 
   level and the assignment of a security classification level to any activity or 
   product data. This capability supports both governmental security and business 
   proprietary information.</p>
