<foreword>
 	This second edition constitutes a technical revision of the first edition (ISO 10303-520:1999), 
 	which is provisionally retained 
 	in order to support continued use and maintenance of implementations based on the first edition and to satisfy 
 	the normative references of other parts of ISO 10303.
 </foreword>

 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
    This International Standard is organized as a series of parts, each published separately.
    The parts of ISO 10303 fall into one of the following series: description methods, integrated resources,
	application interpreted constructs, application protocols, abstract test suites, implementation
	methods, and conformance testing.
	The series are described in ISO 10303-1.
	This part of ISO 10303 is a member of the application interpreted constructs series.
   </p>
   <p>
   	An application interpreted construct (AIC) provides a logical grouping of interpreted constructs
	that supports a specific functionality for the usage of product data across multiple application contexts.
	An interpreted construct is a common interpretation of the integrated resources that supports shared information 
	requirements among application protocols.
   </p>
   <p>
    This document specifies the application interpreted construct for the description of structures
	to associate the annotation used in draughting with the geometric aspects of the shape where the annotation applies.
   </p>
   <p>
	   	The second edition of this part of ISO 10303 incorporates modifications that are upwardly compatible with the first edition.	
	   	Modifications to EXPRESS specifications are upwardly compatible if:
   </p>
   <ul>
   		<li>
	   		instances encoded according to ISO 10303-21, and that conform to an ISO 10303 application
			protocol based on the previous edition of this part of ISO 10303, also conform to a revision of that 
			application protocol based on this edition of this part of ISO 10303;
		</li>
		<li>
			interfaces that conform to ISO 10303-22 and to an ISO 10303 application protocol based on the
			previous edition of this part of ISO 0303, also conform to a revision of that application protocol 
			based on this edition of this part of ISO 10303;
		</li>
		<li>
			the mapping tables of ISO 10303 application protocols based on the previous edition of this 
			part of ISO 10303 remain valid in a revision of that application protocol based on this edition of this part of ISO 10303.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Technical modifications to the first edition of this part of ISO 10303 are categorised as follows: changes to the EXPRESS
		declarations, new EXPRESS declarations, and changes to definitions of EXPRESS entity data types.
	</p>
	<!-- aic_associative_draughting_elements -->
	<p>The following aic_associative_draughting_elements EXPRESS declarations and interface specifications have been modified:</p>

		<li>USE FROM presentation_appearance_schema;</li>
		<li>USE FROM presentation_organization_schema;</li>

		<li>shape_aspect_associativity;</li>
		<li>representations_mapped_into.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The following aic_associative_draughting_elements EXPRESS declarations and interface specifications have been added:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>USE FROM geometry_schema(axis2_placement);</li>
		<li>aade_annotation_representation_select;</li>
		<li>aade_invisibility_context;</li>
