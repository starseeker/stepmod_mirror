 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application resource for the
     representation of  classes or sets and classification relationships. This part of ISO 10303 also supports the following set theory relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>complement;</li>
<li>intersection;</li>
<li>power set;</li>
<li>proper subset;</li>
<li>same membership (that is, set equality);</li> 
<li>subset;</li>
<li>union.</li>
</ul>

   <introduction>The classification_schema specifies a class, and a classification relationship between a class and a member of a class.
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons><p>For many different entity types defined within ISO 10303, an instance may stand for a class or set of things. The fact that an instance stands for a class or set of things can be made explicit by creating a compound instance of:</p> 
<ul>
<li>the entity type class defined in this part of ISO 10303, and</li>
<li>
another entity type defined in ISO 10303. </li></ul>
<p>Members can be specified for an instance of the entity type class. An instance of the entity type class can be involved in set theory relationships, such as union or intersection, with other instances of the entity type class.</p>
<note>Instances of the entity types product, product_definition_formation and product_definition in ISO 10303-41 can be classes. In order to allow set theory relationships for these classes, an application protocol or application module can define a subtype of:</note>
<ul>
<li>product_definition_formation (from ISO 10303-41);</li>
<li>class (from this part of ISO 10303).</li>
</ul>
<example number="1">
Pump model 'XYZ_123' is a product_definition_formation and a class. This class is a class_by_extension.</example>

<example number="2">The set of pumps enumerated in maintenance contract '98/1234' is a class. This class is a class_by_intension.</example>

<example number="3">The relationship between individual pump 'X/85/4567' and pump model 'XYZ_123', that indicates the model of the pump, is a classification.</example>
<example number="4">The relationship between individual pump 'X/85/4567' and the set of pumps enumerated in maintenance contract '98/1234', that indicates it is one of the set, is a classification. The complete set of pumps covered by the contract can be defined by an instance of the entity type complete_membership.
</example>
<example number="5">The set of pumps that are both within maintenance contract '98/1234' and of pump model 'XYZ_123' can be defined by the set theory relationship intersection.</example>

   <introduction>The set_theory_schema specifies the following relationships between classes:
<ul>
<li>complement;</li>
<li>intersection;</li>
<li>power set;</li>
<li>proper subset;</li>
<li>same membership (that is, set equality);</li>

   <fund_cons><p>The set theory schema defines set theory relationship between classes or sets.</p>

<note number="1">In this part of ISO 10303, the terms class and set are synonyms.</note>

<p>In order to use this schema the entity that records the class or set shall be <express_ref linkend="classification_and_set_theory:ir:classification_schema.class"/> or a subtype of <express_ref linkend="classification_and_set_theory:ir:classification_schema.class"/>.</p>
<example number="1"><p>Consider the following instances of <express_ref linkend="classification_and_set_theory:ir:classification_schema.class"/>:</p>
<ul><li>
pump model 'XYZ_123', which is a <express_ref linkend="product_definition_schema:ir_express:product_definition_schema.product_definition_formation"/>

 and a <express_ref linkend="classification_and_set_theory:ir:classification_schema.class"/>; and </li><li>
the set of pumps enumerated in maintenance contract '98/1234'. 
</li></ul>
<p>An instance of the relationship <express_ref linkend="classification_and_set_theory:ir:set_theory_schema.subset"/>

 indicates that each of the set of pumps enumerated in maintenance contract '98/1234' is of pump model 'XYZ_123'.
</p></example>

<example number="2"><p>An organization has pumps of type A and type B. Some pumps handle radioactive fluids. There are the following classes of activity:</p>
<ul><li>
SA - service pump type A;</li><li>
SB - service pump type B;</li><li>
DR - service equipment that has handled radioactive fluids. 
</li></ul>
<p>For workflow management purposes, the following derived class of activity is defined:</p>
<ul><li>
DRS - service pump that has handled radioactive fluids. 
</li></ul><p>This class is the <express_ref linkend="classification_and_set_theory:ir:set_theory_schema.intersection"/>

 of class DR with the <express_ref linkend="classification_and_set_theory:ir:set_theory_schema.union"/>

 of classes SA and SB.</p></example>
