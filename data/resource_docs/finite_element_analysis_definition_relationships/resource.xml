 <abstract>
    <p>This document specifies the association between idealised concepts within a finite element analysis and the design definitions of those concepts. The concepts that are idealised within a finite element analysis include the action that is simulated, the states of the product, and the section properties.
 This document also specifies the association between a representation of a field that is calculated by a finite element analysis and a property of a defined state of a product.

 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application resource for the
     representation of of product information and for the exchange of product data. 
     The objective is to provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing products 
     throughout their life cycle. This mechanism is suitable not only for neutral file exchange, 
     but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases, and as a basis for archiving. 
     This part of ISO 10303 is a member of the integrated application resources series. 
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies the fea_definition_relationships_schema.
</p><p>
This part of ISO 10303 provides a means of associating finite element analysis information with 
information about the design and structure of a product. This part of ISO 10303 provides links 
between:</p>

<ul><li>finite element information specified by ISO 10303-104; and</li>

<li>both:<ul>
<li>the product and property definition information specified by ISO 10303-41; and</li>
<li>the product topology information specified by ISO 10303-42.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
 





<p>
These links enable the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a finite element analysis step can be linked to the design specification of the action that the finite element analysis step simulates;
</li></ul>
<note number="1"> This provides additional information about the analysis step, and a navigation route to the analysis step using a Product Data Management (PDM) system.</note>
<ul><li>
a finite element analysis state can be linked to the design specification of the product state that it calculates;
</li></ul>
<note number="2"> This provides additional information about the analysis state, and a navigation route to the analysis state using a PDM system. </note>
<ul><li>
a surface or curve section property can be linked to the design specification of the section;
</li></ul>
<note number="3"> This provides additional information about the section and its properties. The design specification of a variation of surface section properties with respect to position can be specified using ISO 10303-51 and ISO 10303-50.</note>
<ul><li>
an FEA node, FEA element or aspect of an FEA element can be linked to the topology of a product.
</li></ul>
<note number="4">This provides a direct link between the features of a product as identified by its CAD topology and FEA. This will enable the results from an analysis to be related to a design feature.</note>
<p>
The relationships of the schemas in this part of ISO 10303 to other schemas that define the integrated resources of this International Standard are illustrated in Figure 1 using the EXPRESS-G notation. EXPRESS-G is defined in annex D of ISO 10303-11.

  A finite element analysis is based upon an idealisation of an activity, state, property distribution, or shell or beam section. A single activity, state, property distribution, or shell or beam section can have many different idealisations that are used in, or created by, many different finite element analyses.
