LATEX tool texcad has been used to draw the diagrams and then produce a .gif image from the pdf file produced. 
A picture editor then gives the coordinates required for the .xml file.

Texcad is available here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/texcad/

Latex source files are in the same directory than this readme.txt file
