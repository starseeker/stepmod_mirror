 <purpose>
   <p>
     This part of ISO 10303 specifies an application resource for the
     representation of of mathematical values, spaces and functions to describe or identify products, states and activities. 
sche   </p>
<p>A mathematical value can identify a product, product feature, state or activity.
</p><example number="1">
The temperature sensor at position P in my_test_rig is identified by the integer value 27. </example>

A mathematical value can describe a physical quantity value.
<example number="2">
The temperature, which is possessed by my_test_rig at position P in state S, is described by the real value 45.3 with respect to the Celsius scale.
</example>
A mathematical space can provide an identification scheme, or parameterisation, for a set or space of products, product features, states or activities.
<example number="3">
The members of the set of temperature sensors in my_test_rig are identified by integers in the interval [1, 200].
</example>
A mathematical space can provide an identification scheme, or parameterisation, for a physical quantity space.
<example number="4">
The values within the temperature physical quantity space are described or identified by reals in the set greater than -273.17.
</example>
A mathematical function can describe a variation of property with respect to position within a set of products, product features, states or activities.
<example number="5">
The variation of temperature with respect to the sensors within my_test_rig in state S is described by a discrete function from the integer interval [1, 200] to the set of reals greater than -273.17. This function is understood with respect to a particular parameterisation of the temperature sensors and with respect to the Celsius scale.
</example>
The relationships of the schemas in this part of ISO 10303 to other schemas that define the integrated resources of this International Standard are illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2 using the EXPRESS-G notation. EXPRESS-G is defined in annex D of ISO 10303-11. Figure 1 shows references to schemas containing entities that are described. Figure 2 shows references to schemas containing entities that define the nature of the description.

<p>
There are properties for each of the planes in the volume, such as average pressure, average velocity and average temperature. Hence there is a variation of average pressure (say) with respect to the set of planes.

   <introduction>
<p>The <b>mathematical_context_schema</b> specifies a mapping between a physical set or space and a mathematical space.
</p>
<p>
The physical set can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a family of products;</li>

<li>positions within a product;</li>

<li>states within an activity or state space;</li>

<li>physical quantity values within a physical quantity space.</li>
</ul>

The mapping defines an identification scheme for members of the physical set. A member of the physical set is identified by a mathematical value within the mathematical space.

<example number="1">The set cross sections along beam 'XB_1234' are identified by the set real values in the range [-1.0, +1.0].
</example>
<example number="2">The set of states during the activity that is 'normal start up of engine type XYZ_123' are identified by the set of real values in the range [0.0, 1.0].
</example>
<example number="3">The set of temperatures are identified by the set of real values greater that -273.15
</example>
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
     A mapping between a physical set and a mathematical space is called a parameterisation if the physical set is:
<ul>
<li>a family of products;</li>

<li>positions within a product; or</li>

<li>states within an activity or state space.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A parameterisation can be given a name. There are two ways of providing more information about a parameterisation, as follows:
</p>
<p>
the mathematical value can be specified for each member of the physical set (provided the physical set is finite); or
</p>
<p>
a property distribution can be described with respect to the parameterisation, as described in the mathematical description of distribution schema.
</p>
<example number="1">A parameterisation is defined for the set of cross sections within beam 'XB_1234'. A description of the positions of the cross-sections within the beam for its initial undeformed state provides information about the nature of the parameterisation.
</example>

<example number="2">A parameterisation is defined for the set of states within the activity that is 'normal start up of engine type XYZ_123'. A description of the times of the states within the start up activity provides information about the nature of the parameterisation.
</example>
<p>A mapping between a physical quantity space and a mathematical space is called a scale. A scale can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a standard scale defined by ISO or some other standardisation body, i.e by a unit of measure; or</li>

<li>defined with respect to another scale by a transformation, such as a 3D coordinate transformation.</li>
</ul>
<note>This part of ISO 10303 references ISO 10303-43 'Integrated generic resources: Representation structures' for entities that define a scale.
</note>
<example number="3"><p>The International Practical Temperature Scale 1968 (IPTS-68) is a mapping between the space of temperatures and the set of real numbers greater than -273.15.</p>
<p>
The fixed points within the scale are degrees of hotness that are identified by particular physical phenomena, such as the freezing point of gold. For each fixed point, a real value is assigned.

   <introduction><p>The <b>mathematical_description_of_distribution_schema</b> specifies a mapping between a property distribution and a mathematical function. The mapping gives semantics to the mathematical function, so that the mathematical function describes or identifies the property distribution.
</p>
<p>A property distribution can be with respect to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>product within a family of products;</li>

<li>position within a product;</li>

<li>state within an activity or state space;</li>

<li>outlet port diameter for an engine in family 'XYZ_1'; and</li>

<li>engine speed in Hertz;</li>
</ul><p>is a property distribution.</p>
</example>
<example number="2"><p>The variation of temperature with respect to:</p>
<ul>
<li>position within the product that is the compressor disc of engine type 'XYZ_123'; and</li>

</ul>
<p>is a property distribution.</p>
</example>
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
     A property distribution is a physical function. The domain of a property distribution function can be:
<ul>
<li>a set of products;</li>

<li>a set of positions within a product;</li>

<li>a set of states within an activity or state space.</li>
</ul>
The range of a property distribution function is a physical quantity space.
<p>
A property distribution D:X->P, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>X is the domain set; and</li>

<li>P is the range physical quantity space,</li>
</ul>
can be described or identified by a mathematical function F:A->B, where

A and B are mathematical spaces;

<p>The description or identification depends upon:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a one to one mapping U:X->A; and</li>

<li>a one to one mapping V:P->B.</li>
</ul>

The property distribution D is described or identified by the mathematical function F, if and only if:

V(D(x)) = F(U(x)), for all x in X.
