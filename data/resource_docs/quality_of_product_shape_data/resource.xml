 <abstract>
    <p>This part of ISO 10303 provides structured representation of criteria together with measurement requirement,
     and inspection results of the data quality of product shape and related data. 
     It is designed for use in quality declaration, quality assurance and for representing quality inspection
     result of product shape data and related data, thus enabling quality guaranteed product data exchange.</p>

 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
Before going into details of the quality of product data, it will be useful to note that quality of product 
(physical object), quality of product model, and quality of product model data are different concepts. 
With reference to the definition of the term ‘quality’ in ISO 9000, we define the term ‘quality of product’ 
as ‘a measure of degree of satisfaction of requirements of a product on appearance, functionality and performance’. 
The conceptual product model is adequately defined in ISO 10303 but there is currently very little provision for 
the specification of quality of product model. 
Only tolerance information associated to a product model may be categorized as the information concerning 
quality of product model. Product model data is a representation of a (conceptual) product model with a 
finite number of digits. It naturally includes numerical precision problems. 
Slight inconsistencies amongst geometric entities, topological entities and between geometry and topology 
may be inappropriate for some applications. 
All product model data are created by some CAD system and it is well known that the numerical representation 
method and precision obtained are CAD system dependent. 
This part of ISO 10303 deals with the erroneous or inappropriate characteristics of product model data. 
</p>
 <p>
Other ISO standards that have provisions on the quality of products, including specification, 
verification and process for improvements, have no information on the quality of product data. 
Product data quality related specification in ISO 10303 is at present restricted to the overall numerical 
precision of an entire product model. 
Provision of more detailed specifications for the representation of the quality of product data, 
especially that of three dimensional shape data, will promote quality guaranteed (assured) data exchange 
and will reduce unnecessary rework to adjust the transferred product data to a usable state in the receiving system.
 </p>
 <p>
This part of ISO 10303 consists of five mutually related schemas as shown in Figure E.2 in Annex E. 
The first schema, namely the product data quality definition schema, defines high level data elements for 
managing product data quality information such as the relationship of the product data quality information 
with the product data inspected. 
</p>

<!-- 
<figure>
<title>EXPRESS-G diagram of the overall model structure</title>
<img src="IntroFigure1.gif"/>
</figure>
 -->
<p>
The second schema, namely the product data quality criteria schema, deals with general product data 
and specifies how to represent quality criteria and quality measurement requirements. 
The third schema, namely the product data quality inspection result schema, also deals with general product 
data and specifies how to represent quality inspection results. 
Specifications defined in the second and the third schemas are sufficiently general so that quality of 
various types of product data other than shape data can be dealt with in the future.
This edition includes a technical revision of the first edition in order to cope with non-geometric data 
quality issues. 
</p>
<note number="1">
Standards for dealing with non-geometric data quality issues are 'externally conditioned data quality'
modules which are specializations of the second and the third schemas.
<!-- 
A standard for dealing with non-geometric data quality issues is currently under development as a 
module by the name of 'externally conditioned data quality' as a specialization of the second and the 
third schemas.
 -->
</note>
 <p>
Two schemas, the shape data quality criteria schema and the shape data quality inspection result schema 
are specializations of the product data quality criteria schema and the product data quality inspection 
result schema respectively to shape data. 
The quality of product shape data is modelled in this part of ISO 10303 by classifying practical inconveniences 
including erroneous data, inappropriate data or other items that hinder successful data exchange. 
These mainly arise due to inappropriate numerical representation of the underlying mathematical model. 
The classification is based on the taxonomy of known problems caused by low quality product shape data. 
Major classifications are ‘erroneous data’ and ‘inapt data’. 
Problems are further categorized as geometry issues, topology issues, combined geometry /topology issues and 
geometric model issues. 
 </p>
 <p>
The target product shape data representation is limited in this part of ISO 10303 to the data conforming to 
ISO 10303-42 although it may be enhanced to allow other representations including native CAD data in future editions. 
</p>
 <p>
Each criterion includes a corresponding measurement requirement. 
A measurement requirement provides a textual description of how the criterion is to be measured and may 
have additional attributes and rules to control the test and the element or elements to be tested. 
It does not provide an algorithm for the measurement process. 
It is expected that the developer of a product data quality checking program will develop his algorithm for 
the measurement so that that algorithm satisfies the measurement requirement specified.
</p>
<note number="2">  
Measurement algorithms are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303 since it is understood that 
algorithm development is a competitive arena for engineering system vendors and cannot be standardized 
by an international standard.
</note>
<p>
For the assessment of shape data quality by numerical test, thresholds, which are user definable from application 
protocols supporting shape models, play a key role. 
Enhancement of the existing Application Protocols, such as ISO 10303-203[2] and ISO 10303-214[3], 
to support shape data quality information, or development of new Application Protocols which treat shape data 
quality will be eased by the use of the procedure suggested in [5]. 
An example of a typical threshold is a distance threshold for evaluating a gap between a base surface and 
bounding curves for trimming the effective portion of the surface. 
That distance threshold implies that if the maximum distance between the surface and the curves is 
greater than or equal to the specified minimum value, then the gap shall be understood as a quality defect. 
Appropriate thresholds depend on many factors such as size of a product, design requirements, 
sensitivity of engineering systems to numerical imprecision, etc. 
Therefore, what threshold value to use needs to be carefully determined in each business situation 
based on agreement among business partners.
</p>
 <p>
The shape data quality inspection result schema provides representation of quality inspection results 
for a specific product shape data with regard to specified quality criteria. 
The inspection result indicates whether, or not, the product shape data inspected contains quality defects. 
It may also include detailed information on what type of quality defect is existing, and how serious 
the defect is, together with the shape element data where the problem is detected. 
This information is expected to be useful for the quality healing process and to help efficient 
co-operation between the quality checking process and the healing process of the product shape data.
</p>
<note number="3">
Numbers enclosed in triangles in Figure E.2 denote internal references within the figure. 
This is not standard EXPRESS-G style but is used to prevent complicated long path references. 
Similar notation is also used in Figures E.3, E.4 and E.5. 
</note>

The selection of instantiated data elements from those shown in Figure E.2 depends upon the scenario of quality 
information usage. Amongst the expected scenarios for the use of this part of ISO 10303 are:
<dl>
<dt><b>Requirement of quality:</b></dt>
<dd>
The ordering company may require the company receiving the order to create product data that satisfies 
prescribed quality requirements. 
Examples are exclusion of infinitesimal geometry smaller than the given tolerance, exclusion of redundant 
geometry not contributing to the representation of product shape, etc. 
Very limited information, namely relevant criteria together with required thresholds from those in Figure E.2,
is necessary in this scenario. 
The information may be transferred together with the ordering sheet.
</dd>
<dt><b>Declaration of quality:</b></dt>
<dd> 
The creator of a product data may use quality information for explicitly declaring the quality level 
satisfied by his/her model. 
Depending on the design method and the CAD system used, the quality of the product data may be unambiguously 
declared without any inspection. 
Selective criteria and thresholds for which the model is judged to be quality defect free are required 
information in this scenario. 
The quality information may be transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
</dd>
<dt><b>Assurance of quality:</b></dt>
<dd> 
A quality assurance organization may use quality information for representing the results of quality inspection 
for a particular product model data. 
This scenario will require inspected quality criteria together with thresholds used, 
measurement requirements deployed and inspection results obtained. 
The accuracies used may also be included. 
The information is transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
</dd>
<dt><b>Quality information for use in quality improvement:</b></dt>
<dd> 
If a quality defect is detected by quality inspection, necessary actions for improving 
critical data will be required. 
For that purpose, information on the nature and severity of any quality defects should be provided. 
Therefore, this scenario will require a detailed inspection result report at the geometric entity instance level. 
This information is transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
</dd>
<dt><b>Long term archival of product data:</b></dt>
<dd> 
 It is desirable that a detailed record of product model data quality is archived with product data. 
 The data requirement for this purpose is similar to that needed for assurance of quality.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Illustrative figures showing required information for these scenarios are presented in Annex F.7.
</p>
Constituent schemas of this part of ISO 10303 are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Product_data_quality_definition schema:</b> defines high level data elements for managing product 
data quality information;
</li><li>
<b>Product_data_quality_criteria schema:</b> provides general specifications for the representation of 
quality criteria, quality measurement requirements and quality assessment specifications for product data;
</li><li>
<b>Product_data_quality_inspection_result schema:</b> provides general specifications for the 
representation of quality inspection results for a particular product data;
</li><li>
<b>Shape_data_quality_criteria schema:</b> provides representations of shape data quality criteria 
together with corresponding measurement requirements, thresholds for judging the existence or absence of 
quality defects and assessment specifications for product shape data;
</li><li>
<b>Shape_data_quality_inspection_result schema:</b> provides representations of quality inspection 
results for a particular product shape data with regard to specified quality criteria. 
Detailed information on what type of quality defect is existing, and how serious the defect is, 
together with the shape element data where the problem is detected can also be represented;

   <introduction>
  In order to unambiguously share product data quality information, the following are required:
 <ol type="a">
<li> A clear statement of each quality requirement.  Such a requirement will be referred to as ‘quality criterion’ in this standard.</li>
<li> Specification of necessary conditions for the measurement to be used for ensuring that a quality criterion is met.  
Such conditions are referred to as ‘measurement requirement’ in this standard.  
Each measurement requirement shall specify the types of entities to be checked, the measurement process to be used (if definable), 
and the required accuracy of the measurement.  
Measurement processes are specified in descriptive terms only — the actual measurement algorithms are outside the scope of this standard.</li>
<li>Specification of assessment for judging the acceptability of the quality measurements.  
Such a specification is referred to as ‘assessment specification’ in this standard.  
Assessment specifications for the quality of 3D shape models fall into two classes, 
the first involving numerical test with one or two thresholds for acceptability, 
and the second involving logical test (details will be presented in clause 7).</li>
<li>Provision of a method for selecting required inspection report type.</li>
<li>Specification for the representation of inspection results.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This schema provides representations for items a. – d. that are mandatory in any application.
The information corresponding to e. above is specified in <b>product_data_quality_inspection_result_schema</b>.
</p>
<note>
Scenarios of the expected use of this standard are described in Introduction and annex G.
</note>
   
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
<p>
Concepts and assumptions necessary for understanding this schema follow.
</p>
<b>
5.2.1  Representation of product data quality criteria
</b>
<p>
Product data quality requirement can be unambiguously represented by a combination of quality criteria. 
Each criterion may have one or more associated measurement requirements and assessment specifications.
</p>
<p>
It is anticipated that there are quality criteria for which it is not possible to specify a measurement requirement. 
For this reason, this schema provides both quality criteria with or without relationship to the corresponding 
measurement requirement.
</p>
<example number="1">
‘unmanufacturable data is not acceptable’ is a clear and important product data quality requirement. 
In this case, ‘existence of unmanufacturable data’ will become a criterion. 
Therefore, satisfaction of the criterion implies the existence of quality defect. 
But, the definition of measurement requirement for completely detecting unmanufacturable data will be very difficult.
</example>
<example number="2">
 A significant gap between a surface and bounding curves for a face on the surface can cause problems 
 for the receiving system. 
 In order to detect that type of low quality data, 
 the criterion ‘<b>gap_between_edge_and_base_surface</b>’ is defined. 
 In order to judge the quality, the related measurement shall be based on the calculation of the 
 distance between a curve and a surface. 
 Ideally the distance shall be calculated as the minimum distance to the surface from a point on the curve. 
 After calculating this distance for all points on the curve, the maximum value amongst them shall be obtained. 
 Then this maximum distance shall be compared with the threshold defined for this criterion for 
 evaluating if quality defect exists. 
 This example shows how a combination of quality criterion, associated measurement requirement and 
 assessment specification forms a core part of the quality model representation.
</example>
<p>
Quality requirement is application dependent and target design requirement dependent. 
This schema allows a user to select a set of necessary criteria from the standardized criteria and 
combine them to represent his requirements on product data quality.
</p><p>
Specifications in this schema are sufficiently general to be applicable for quality of any property of product data. Specialization of this schema to three dimensional product shape data is given in clause 7. Application to other types of product data quality will require further specialization of this schema to be defined.
</p>
<b>
5.2.2  Representation of the requirement on measurement of product data quality
</b>
<p>
Where an inspection report is required, a reliable measurement shall be associated with each quality 
criterion and used to determine whether, or not, the data is defective with respect to that criterion.
</p><p>
The following are requirements for the reliable measurement:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Appropriate data element shall be measured.</li>
<li>Necessary conditions for appropriate measurement shall be clarified such as mandatory 
measurement process if definable, what physical quantity shall be measured, 
what special cases shall be taken into account, required precision of measurement result, etc.</li>
<li>A robust algorithm that satisfies all the requirements represented by 2. above shall be deployed.</li>
</ol>
<note>
It is understood that inspection algorithms belong to a competitive arena for engineering system 
vendors and therefore shall not be standardized. 
For this reason, the requirement 3. above is outside the scope of this standard.
</note>
<p>
The representation of measurement requirement is designed so that it can be referenced both from 
<b>data_quality_criteria_representation</b> and 
<b>data_quality_inspection_result_representation</b>.
</p>
<b>
5.2.3  Control of inspection result report
</b>
<p>
Type of information and level of detail of inspection result report may differ depending the 
scenario of its use or the purpose of the inspection. 
The entity <b>data_quality_report_request</b> provides the representation of a request 
for an inspection report with regard to a particular criterion. 
It has two subtypes, <b>summary_report_request</b> and <b>detailed_report_request</b>. 
The use of <b>summary_report_request</b> is recommended to capture overall quality level 
such as how many entities were checked regarding the criterion and how many entities 
among them were judged as having quality defect. 
The use of <b>detailed_report_request</b> is suited to obtain more detailed report 
such as what entity instance caused quality defect and how serious it is. 
It has attributes to request a report on all the measured elements or only on elements with inferior quality. 
Expected number of elements to be reported and expected sequence of report may also be specified. 
Since these specifications affect other schemas in this standard, 
it is recommended to look into Figure 1 of Introduction to understand related entities in other schemas. 
<b>data_quality_inspection_report</b> of <b>product_data_inspection_result_schema</b> corresponds to 
<b>data_quality_report_request</b> of this schema. 
It has two subtypes, <b>data_quality_inspection_criterion_report</b> which corresponds to 
<b>summary_report_request</b> of this schema and <b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report</b> 
which corresponds to <b>detailed_report_request</b> of this schema. 
<b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report</b> is a collection of <b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b>
 which corresponds to one instance or one pair of instances of the given product data. 
</p>
<note>
In <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_result_schema</b>, <b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b> is 
specialized to <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b> which has a subtype 
<b>instance_report_item_with_extreme_instances</b> for representing quality defect in shape 
entity instance level and how serious it is. 
</note>
<example>
The following explanation assumes the case where only report on inferior quality elements is requested. 
In the case of ‘<b>short_length_edge</b>’ criterion, two or more edges may be detected as 
having shorter length than the specified threshold. 
The entity <b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report</b> 
(or <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report</b>) will report all the detected edges. 
The entity <b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b> 
(or <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b>) corresponds to one detected edge. 
In the case of ‘<b>multiply_defined_faces</b>’ criterion, two or more pairs of <b>face_surface</b>s 
may be detected as having duplication. 
<b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report</b> 
(or <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report</b>) will report all the pairs of 
<b>face_surface</b>s detected. 
<b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b> 
(or <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b>) corresponds to one pair of 
<b>face_surface</b>s.

   <introduction>
<p>
This schema provides general specifications for the representation of the results of quality inspection of product data. 
Inspection results show the level of product data quality of particular product data instance with regard to specified quality criteria.
Therefore, identification of the product data instance inspected and the relationship to corresponding quality criteria specified are provided.
</p>
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
<p>
Concepts and assumptions necessary for understanding this schema follow.
</p><p>
The requirement for inspection results depends upon the usage scenario of product data quality information.
When only quality requirements are transferred or declaration of satisfied quality is transferred, inspection results are not required.
</p>
<note>
See annex E for details on what kind of quality related information is required for each expected usage scenario.
</note>
<p>
An instance of <b>data_quality_inspection_result</b> represents the inspection result corresponding to exactly one data quality criterion.
There are cases that judgement on whether to regard obtained inspection result as quality defect or not is application dependent. 
Therefore, two entities with and without judgement are provided.
</p>
<p>
To represent entire inspection result corresponding to a set of specified product data quality criteria, 
<b>data_quality_inspection_result_representation</b> is provided.
It is a collection of <b>data_quality_inspection_result</b>s. 
The relationship between the former and the latter is identical with that between <b>representation</b> and <b>representation_item</b>.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of inspection result report. 
One is a summary report that identifies the quality criterion checked and describes the inspection results
 without giving detailed information about the extent of the defect and what entity instance was responsible. 
 This information may be used to judge the overall quality level of the target product data with respect to one criterion. 
 The other is a detailed report that represents the inspection result at entity instance level to show which particular 
 entity instance caused what kind and degree of quality defect. 
 This information may be used for improving the quality of the target product data instance.
</p>
<p>
Specifications in this schema are enough general so that they can be applied for the representation
 of inspection result of any property of a product data. 
Specialization of this schema to three dimensional product shape data is given in clause 8. 
Specialization to inspection result of any property other than product shape will also be possible in the future as a specialization of this schema.

   <introduction>
<p>
 This schema provides representation of quality criteria for three dimensional product shape data. 
 It does not directly define what is good quality data but rather classifies and enumerates quality concerns for detecting low quality data. 
 This schema is a specialization of <b>product_data_quality_criteria_schema</b> presented in clause 5 
 to the quality of three dimensional product shape data. 
 Therefore, all the fundamental concepts and assumptions described in 5.2 also apply. 
 This schema provides classified shape data quality criteria together with corresponding measurement requirements
  and thresholds for the assessment of shape data quality. Accuracy is also related to each criterion when appropriate.
</p>
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
<p>
Concepts and assumptions necessary for understanding this schema follow.
</p>
<b>
7.2.1  Representation of the criteria of product shape data quality and its classification
</b>
<p>
The quality of product shape data is modelled in this part of ISO 10303 by classifying practical inconveniences 
which can require remedial action in the receiving system. 
This identification and classification can potentially improve the efficiency of the data exchange process 
by reducing the required reworking. 
These inconveniences mainly arise due to inappropriate numerical representation or inappropriate 
numerical manipulation of underlying mathematical model, that are highly CAD system dependent. 
The classification is based on taxonomy of known problems caused by low quality product shape data. 
They are classified into two major categories that are ‘erroneous data’ and ‘inapt data’. 
</p>
<note number="1">
It is understood that good quality shape data shall represent design result entirely with acceptable 
precision where degree of satisfaction of design requirements and design intent is explicitly represented. 
Though use of 3D engineering systems is expanding, no system fully supports creation and maintenance of 
good quality shape data as defined above. 
Satisfaction of the requirement 
‘degree of satisfaction of design requirements and design intent is explicitly represented’ is 
still a big unresolved research issue. 
This is the reason why we decided to adopt above described classification.
</note>
<note number="2">
The product shape data considered shall be represented using entities defined in ISO 10303-42. 
Amongst the various representation methods possible, such as boundary representation (B-Rep), 
algebraic representation and CSG, the focus in this part of ISO 10303 is on boundary representation (B-Rep) models.
</note>
<p>
Problems classified as ‘erroneous data’ are those that violate logical consistency of the product data structure. 
In other words, it could be said as mathematically invalid data. 
In contrast, problems classified as ‘inapt data’ are those that are obviously unfavourable for most 
applications though they are not mathematically invalid. Each category of problems is further classified into 
topology related ones, geometry related ones, those related to inappropriate relationship between geometry 
and topology, and those related to shape model.
</p>
<note number="3">
Detailed criteria are classified as subtypes of 
<b>shape_data_quality_criterion</b> that is a type of <b>data_quality_criterion</b> as defined in clause 5:
<b>product_data_quality_criteria_schema</b> of this part of ISO 10303.
</note>
<p>
Aesthetic quality of product shape is a decisive factor for some type of product such as passenger car. 
But, rigorous definition of aesthetic quality is not included in this standard since technology for its 
evaluation is not yet well established though practical functions for its evaluation such as smooth 
highlight lines or smooth curvature distribution are deployed. 
Only criteria requiring smooth free form curves and surfaces are included.
</p>
<p>
Not all product shape data accepted in design phase is acceptable in down stream applications such as 
die design or NC machining. 
Examples in automobile panel design are spring back compensation and over crown compensation. 
Draft angle consideration is another example in mould design area. 
These quality requirements from down stream applications will be typical ‘inapt data’, but inclusion in 
this standard is hesitated since there is no consensus on their representation. 
They could be included in the future versions.
</p>
<b>
7.2.2  Representation of the requirement on measurement of product shape data quality
</b>
<p>
Each criterion has an associated measurement requirement. 
A measurement requirement provides a textual description of how the criterion is to be measured 
and may have additional attributes and rules to control the test and the element or elements to be tested. 
It does not provide an algorithm for the measurement process. 
It may be said that a measurement requirement plays a role of external specification for 
reliable measurement algorithm. 
</p>
<b>
7.2.3  Specialization of data quality assessment specification
</b>
<p>
<b>data_quality_assessment_specification</b> defined in <b>product_data_quality_criteria_schema</b> 
is specialized to shape data quality by 
two subtypes, i.e. <b>shape_data_quality_assessment_by_numerical_test</b> and 
<b>shape_data_quality_assessment_by_logical_test</b>. 
<!-- 
<b>shape_data_quality_assessment_specification</b> in this schema 
that has two subtypes <b>shape_data_quality_assessment_by_numerical_test</b> and 
<b>shape_data_quality_assessment_by_logical_test</b>. 
 -->
For the assessment of <b>shape_data_quality_assessment_by_numerical_test</b>, 
attribute thresholds which are user definable from AP (Application Protocol) play a key role.
An example of a typical threshold is a distance threshold for evaluating a gap between a base 
surface and bounding curves for trimming the effective portion of the surface. 
That distance threshold implies that if the maximum distance between the surface and the curves is 
greater than or equal to the specified minimum value, then the gap shall be understood as a quality defect. 
Appropriate thresholds depend on many factors such as size of a product, design requirements, 
robustness of engineering systems on numerical precision, etc. 
Therefore, what threshold value to use shall be carefully determined in each business situation based on 
agreement among business partners.
</p>
<b>
7.2.4  Representation of required accuracy for shape data quality inspection
</b>
<p>
In most cases, especially when free form geometry is involved, the measurement algorithm calculates an 
approximate solution not an exact solution. 
In the above example, surface and curves consist of an infinite number of points. 
Since calculation on an infinite number of points is impossible, 
any algorithm tries to calculate the solution using a sufficient number of finite points. 
In order to require the difference of the approximate solution and the exact solution, even when it is unknown, 
smaller than the expected value, accuracy specification is provided. 
The intended interpretation of the accuracy specification is that an approximate solution is acceptable 
if the difference between the approximate solution and any other approximate solution obtained 
by calculation with a finer distribution of sampling points is smaller than the given accuracy. 
There are two types of accuracies, one is general accuracy applied to all the measurements and 
the other is specific accuracy applied only to specified measurement. 
</p>
<note number="1">
ISO 10303-45 includes <b>qualified_measure_schema</b> where specifications to qualify measurement 
results of physical object from accuracy point of view are defined. 
Though there are some similarities between the concept defined in that schema and the accuracy concept 
defined in this standard, the latter concerns with the accuracy of numerical calculation. 
It therefore includes accuracy of value without any unit such as accuracy of 
parameter value that is not taken into account in the <b>qualified_measure_schema</b>. 
The accuracy information in this standard is effective for representing requirement of accuracy of 
numerical calculation even when the target product data is not yet identified. 
These are the reasons why the accuracy concept in this standard makes use of only 
appropriate portion of the <b>qualified_measure_schema</b>.

   <introduction>
<p>
This schema provides representation of inspection results of three dimensional product shape data quality. 
This schema is a specialization of <b>product_data_quality_inspection_result_schema</b> defined in clause 6 
to the quality of three dimensional product shape. 
Therefore, all the fundamental concepts and assumptions described in 6.2 also apply. 
</p>
<p>
As this schema deals with inspection result of the quality of product shape data, 
a relationship is established between <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_result_representation</b> 
that is a type of <b>data_quality_inspection_result_representation</b> defined in 
<b>product_data_quality_inspection_result_schema</b> and <b>shape_representation</b> representing the 
inspected product shape data by <b>shape_data_quality_inspected_shape_and_result_relationship</b>.
</p>
<note number="1">
Geometric data newly created for representing inspection results, such as points where quality defect was detected, 
shall be created in the context of the inspected product shape data.
</note>
<p>
A <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_criterion_report</b> is a type of 
<b>data_quality_inspection_criterion_report</b> (see clause 6.4.5) that represents a summary inspection result 
based on a specific shape data quality criterion. 
It specifies how many entities were inspected, and how many among them were judged to have a 
quality defect as judged by this criterion. 
It also specifies a <b>representative_measured_value</b> that is a typical <b>measured_value</b> 
resulting from the inspection, which may be useful to judge how serious the overall quality defect is. 
</p>
<p>
A <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report</b> is a type of <b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report</b> 
(see clause 6.4.6) that represents the most detailed inspection results for a specific shape data quality criterion. 
Two or more instances will in general be inspected or reported as having a quality defect. 
The concept corresponding to one inspected instance or pair of instances is 
<b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b>, a type of 
<b>data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b> (see clause 6.4.7). 
An instance of this entity is created for each instance inspected or pair of instances inspected, 
and it includes information concerning the shape element types inspected and the corresponding measured values. 
If it is required to capture precisely where an extreme measured value was detected, 
<b>instance_report_item_with_extreme_instances</b> shall be used. 
This is a type of <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b> that provides the required  
location information.
</p>
<note number="2">
The type of shape element to be measured and the type of shape element to represent the location of 
quality defect are controlled by each subtype of <b>shape_data_quality_criterion</b> defined in 
<b>shape_data_quality_criteria_schema</b>. 
The number of <b>shape_data_quality_inspection_instance_report_item</b> instances to be generated can be 
controlled by the attributes of <b>data_quality_report_request</b> defined in 
<b>product_data_quality_criteria_schema</b>.
</note>
<p>
Users will specify thresholds to judge if a criterion is satisfied or not, which depends on business situation. 
They may or may not specify the accuracy for controlling precision of numerical calculation used in the measurement.  
But there are many cases that the information on the accuracy that is actually applied by the measurement 
is useful to interpret an inspection result. 
For this purpose, representation of a common accuracy applied to every measurement as well as the accuracy 
applied to the measurement of a specific criterion is provided in this schema.
</p>
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
   <p>
   Concepts and assumptions necessary for understanding this schema follow.
</p><b>
8.2.1  Representation of location information on existing quality defect
</b>
<p>
This schema allows representation of precise location information on existing quality defects.
</p>
<example>
A <b>point_on_edge_curve</b> can be used to represent the location of a quality defect regarding the 
test on ‘<b>gap_between_edge_and_base_surface</b>’ criterion. 
</example>
<note>
In the example above, the detected <b>edge_curve</b> should be reliably identified by all checking systems 
but the point information should be treated as a reference to approximate location.

 <tech_discussion>
 <b><i>E.1  Background</i></b>
<p>
Increase of the use of engineering systems (CAD/CAM/CAE/CG systems) in product development has 
revealed the significance of product data quality (PDQ) as a key issue for realizing successful 
collaborative product development based on product data.
</p>
<p>
A NIST report titled “Economic Impact Assessment of the International Standard for the Exchange of 
Product Model Data (STEP) in Transportation Industries”[6] estimates that one billion dollars per 
year saving will be realized by full use of STEP in US transportation industries (Aerospace, Automotive, 
Shipbuilding). 
Improvement of PDQ that eliminates rework could realize further cost savings.
</p>
<p>
Namely, establishment of widely acceptable methodology for guaranteeing appropriate quality of product 
model data is critically important for drastically raising effectiveness of the use of 3D engineering 
systems and for decreasing economic loss.
</p>
<p>
SASIG’s initiative to develop the automotive PDQ guidelines is a major response to this critical issue. 
However, PDQ issues are not specific to the automotive industry, but are common to all manufacturing industries. 
PDQ criteria and acceptable values may differ from one industry to another, and this part of ISO 10303 is 
intended to allow for such differences.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, standardization of PDQ methodology is expected to encourage IT vendors to develop better 
systems in view of product data quality.
</p>

 <b><i>E.2  Definition of product data quality</i></b>
<p>
Although importance of product data quality has been widely recognized, it is not yet clearly defined 
what “product data quality” is. 
In the discussion of “product data quality”, we have to distinguish quality of “product data” from that 
of “product” itself and “product model”, because these three types of qualities are often mixed up in 
conventional context.
</p>
<p>
“Product” is a manufactured physical body, and “product model” is a mathematical model to 
represent “product” on computers. 
“Product data” is numerical data that represent product information in accordance with “product model.”
</p>
<p>
“Product quality” is defined as the degree of satisfaction of users’ requirements on its function, 
performance, appearance and so on. 
There are a number of existing researches and achievements on “product quality.” 
We also have the standard “ISO 9000” for the management of “product quality.”
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, we don’t even have a basic definition of “product model quality.”
</p>
<p>
Since “product data” is based on “product model”, it is difficult to give rigorous or theoretical 
definition of “product data quality” today.
</p>
<p>
This is the reason why we adopt in this standard a practical approach described below for modelling 
“product data quality.”
</p>
 <figure number="E.1">
 <title>Quality of product, product model and product data</title>
 <img src="fig-e.1.gif"/>
 </figure>
<p>
Issues that hinder successful exchange or sharing of product data have been categorized as either erroneous data or inapt data. Each of these classes has been further categorized into the subclasses of geometry-specific issues, topology-specific issues, combined geometry and topology issues and geometric modelling issues. These are further discussed in clause E.4.
</p>

 <b><i>E.3  Target data type of PDQ-S</i></b>
<p>
Among variety of information consisting of product data, we concentrate on three dimensional shape data 
in this standard though schemas for allowing future extension to cope with non-shape data 
quality are also included. 
The reason why we concentrate on three dimensional shape data is that it is the core information and most 
repair work is done to improve shape data today. 
Reflecting our focus, this project is called “PDQ-S.” (Product Data Quality – Shape)
</p>
<p>
There are various ways to represent three dimensional product shape, B-rep, CSG and parametric 
feature based representation. 
Among them, we concentrate on parametric curves and surfaces, and B-rep data, because these data are 
majority of 3D shape data transferred and shared today.
</p>
<p>
Although use of parametrically represented 3D shape data in explicit form with geometric constraints, 
implicit form with construction history, or with their mixture are increasing especially in solid 
modelling environment, it will take some time to enable parametric data exchange since some of 
the related standards in ISO 10303 have reached to IS level very recently. 
Therefore, we will leave quality of shape data with parametric information as a future issue.
</p>
 <b><i>E.4  Quality criteria of three-dimensional shape data</i></b> 
<p>
Quality criteria of three-dimensional shape data are classified into the following classes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Erroneous data;</li>
<li>Inapt data;</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these classes is further categorized into the following sub-classes:
</p><ul>
<li>Geometry specific issue;</li>
<li>Topology specific issue;</li>
<li>Combined geometry and topology issue;</li>
<li>Geometric model issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>
‘Erroneous data’ implies mathematically invalid product shape data. 
Amongst examples are erroneous b_spline surface definition, open edge loop and inconsistent face and 
underlying surface normals.
</p>
<p>
‘Inapt data’ implies data inappropriate for applications though it may not be mathematically incorrect. 
Amongst examples are self-intersecting curve, non-manifold at edge, narrow width surface patch and 
gap between bounding edge and underlying surface.
</p>
<p>
Even when shape data have acceptable quality in the senses described above, there exists a number of 
cases where engineers in downstream processes have to rework on the data.
</p>
<p>
For example, mould design engineers have to modify a product shape data if appropriate draft angle is not 
taken into account in the data. 
Just knowing the fact whether various manufacturing requirements are incorporated into the data or not 
may save the cost of rework. 
Therefore, these issues are within the scope of this project because they hinder circulation of product 
data from up stream to down stream.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately we cannot focus on them in this initial version because the information to be incorporated 
is not yet well formalized. 
But it’s among one of the most important open issues for this project.
</p>

 <b><i>E.5  Thresholds and Accuracies</i></b>
<p>
For the assessment of shape data quality by numerical test, thresholds which are user definable from 
AP (Application Protocol) play a key role. 
An example of a typical threshold is a distance threshold for evaluating a gap between a base surface 
and bounding curves for trimming the effective portion of the surface. 
That distance threshold implies that maximum distance between the surface and the curves shall 
be smaller than the threshold. 
Appropriate thresholds depend on many factors such as size of a product, design requirements, 
robustness of engineering systems on numerical precision, etc. 
Therefore, what threshold value to use shall be carefully determined in each business situation based 
on agreement among business partners.
</p>
<p>
In most cases, especially when free form geometry is involved, the measurement algorithm calculates an 
approximate solution not an exact solution. 
In the above example, surface and curves consist of an infinite number of points. 
Since calculation on an infinite number of points is impossible, any algorithm tries to calculate 
the solution using a sufficient number of finite points. 
In order to require the difference of the approximate solution and the exact solution, even when 
it is unknown, smaller than the expected value, accuracy specification is provided. 
The accuracy shall be understood that an approximate solution is acceptable if the difference of the 
approximate solution and other approximate solution obtained by calculation with any other 
finer sampling points is smaller than the given accuracy. 
There are two types of accuracies, one is general accuracy applied to all the measurements and the 
other is specific accuracy applied only to specified measurement. 
</p>

 <b><i>E.6  Assumptions on representation of product data</i></b>
<p>
The following two assumptions are rather reluctantly adopted in this standard.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Inspection target product data is limited to those conformant with ISO 10303.</li>
<li>Quality data is assumed to be stored in the same STEP file as the inspection target product data</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is clearly understood that product data quality is a common issue for all the product data representations. 
The reason why assumption-1 is adopted is that consistency of PDQ data and inspection target product data , 
such as consistency of representation context, is only guaranteed if the inspection target product data 
is conformant with ISO 10303. 
If this consistency issue is resolved, then the usability of this standard will be easily extended to 
other product data representations.
</p>
<p>
As already described, it is understood that PDQ data is not a constituent of product data. 
It implies that PDQ data may or may not be stored together with the inspection target product data. 
The reason why assumption-2 is adopted is that no methodology currently exists within SC4 to refer to 
entity instance in externally defined product data file. 
If entity instance reference mechanism to external file is provided then this limitation will be 
immediately removed and PDQ data and the inspection target product data could become represented in 
separate files with necessary relationship on condition that the entity instance reference mechanism to 
external file does not require the change of quality model information structure.
</p>

 <b><i>E.7  Scenarios for the use of this standard</i></b>
<p>
The following subsections define data elements from
<!-- Figure 1 (see Introduction) --> 
to be instantiated for different usage scenarios involving quality information concerning product data. 
For each case, the associated figure in this annex is a modified version of Figure E.2 retaining only 
required data elements.
</p>
 <figure number="E.2">
 <title>EXPRESS-G diagram of the overall model structure</title>
<img src="IntroFigure1.gif"/>
 </figure>

 <b><i>E.7.1  Requirement and Declaration of data quality </i></b>
<p>
Ordering company may require ordered company to create a product data so that it satisfies 
prescribed quality requirements. 
Examples are not to include infinitesimal geometry smaller than the given tolerance, 
exclusion of redundant geometry not contributing to the representation of product shape, etc. 
Very limited information, namely relevant criteria together with required thresholds from those in Figure E.2, 
is necessary in this scenario. 
The information may be transferred together with the ordering sheet.
</p><p>
The creator of a product data may use quality information for explicitly declaring the quality level 
satisfied by his/her model. 
Depending on the design method and the CAD system used, the quality of the product data may be 
unambiguously declared without any inspection. 
Selective criteria and thresholds for which the model is judged to be quality defect free are required 
information in this scenario. 
The quality information may be transferred together with the corresponding product model data.

 <b><i>E.7.1.2  Assurance of data quality, and long term data archiving</i></b>
<p>
A quality assurance organization may use quality information for representing the results of quality inspection 
for a particular product model data. 
This scenario will require inspected quality criteria together with thresholds used, 
measurement requirements deployed and inspection results obtained. The accuracies used may also be included. 
The information is transferred together with the corresponding product model data.
</p><p>
It is desirable that a detailed record of product model data quality is archived with product data. The
data requirement for this purpose is similar to that needed for assurance of quality.

 <b><i>E.7.1.3  Data quality information for use in quality improvement</i></b>
<p>
If a quality defect is detected by quality inspection, necessary actions for improving critical data will be 
required. 
For that purpose, information on the nature and severity of any quality defects should be provided. 
Therefore, this scenario will require a detailed inspection result report at the geometric entity instance level. 
This information is transferred together with the corresponding product model data.

 <examples>
<p>
 This annex provides some example instantiations of ISO 10303-59. 
 First, a graphical notation for the presentation of instances is explained that is a customization of 
 EXPRESS-G for ease of understanding. 
 Two practically important criteria,
  <express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>
  and 
  <express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.gap_between_edge_and_base_surface"/>,
  are selected as examples. 
 Example instances are generated for the three scenarios described in Annex E.7, i.e., 
 requirements/declaration of data quality, assurance of data quality and data quality information 
 for use in quality improvement.
</p>
 <b><i>F.1  Graphical notation of instances</i></b>

<p>
The graphical notation for the presentation of instances 
used in this clause includes some extensions to conventional EXPRESS-G: 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Multiple instances can be presented for a model entity.</li>
<li> Actual values can be presented using call-outs.</li>
<li> An instance for a group of entities with inheritance relationships is shown by circumscribed broken lines. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Figure F.1 illustrates an example usage of the notation. 
Three instances created for the EXPRESS-G model on the left, are shown on the right. 
The diagram shows three instances of person, namely John, Mary and their son Mike.
 </p>

 <figure number="F.1">
 <title> Example usage of the notation</title>

 </figure>

 <b><i>F.2  Instances for short_length_edge</i></b>
<p>
As described in Annex E.7, ISO 10303-59 assumes the following scenarios. 
Examples are expanded to each of these scenarios.
</p><ol>
<li>Representation of requirements of data quality</li>
<li>Representation of declaration of data quality</li>
<li>Representation of assurance of data quality</li>
<li>Representation of data quality information for use in quality improvement</li>
</ol>
<p>
Since the same data are required for scenario 1 and 2, three kinds of examples are shown below.
</p><p>
The first example criterion is 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>. 
If this criterion is assigned as a concern, the PDQ checking system shall inspect the target shape model 
and shall detect any edge whose length is shorter than the given threshold. 
The definition of the entity 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>
is shown in 7.4.88. 
 A typical example of short length edge is shown in Figure F.2.
</p>
 <figure number="F.2">
 <title>A typical example of short length edge</title>
 <img src="fig-f.2.gif"/>
 </figure>

<p>
(1) Requirement/declaration of quality for 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>.
</p><p>
The first two scenarios are requirement of data quality and declaration of data quality. 
As described in Annex E.7, if you are in a position of ordering a design job to some other company, 
you can use this type of quality information to require the company receiving the order to create a 
product data that satisfies your prescribed quality requirements. 
If you are a creator of a product data, you can use this type of quality information for explicitly 
declaring the quality level satisfied by your model. 
To create this type of quality information by the use of ISO 10303-59, you can select a set of criteria that 
composes your requirements. 
Provide the value of threshold for each criterion and the accuracy of the corresponding measurement if necessary. 
No reference is made to individual product data in 'requirement' case, 
though you may or may not attach the product data you created in 'declaration' case. 
You can assign at most two 
<express_ref linkend="product_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:product_data_quality_criteria_schema.data_quality_report_request"/>s
 to represent the kind of report you need. 
See Figure E.3 in EXPRESS-G for entities required for these two scenarios.
</p><p>
As an example of quality information for this scenario, 
the following data is assumed for the criterion 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The threshold for the detection of 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>
is smaller than or equal to 0.01mm. </li>
<li>Two types of report is required; 
summary report that shows number of inspected instances and number of instances detected as having 
quality defect as well as the report on the edge instances that are shorter than the given threshold.</li>
</ul>
The instances to be created for this scenario are shown in Figures F.3 and F.4. 13 instances are created. 
<note number="1">
Instances whose name is shown in italics differ depending upon the criterion. 
In this case, criterion 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>
 requires 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.shape_data_quality_assessment_by_numerical_test"/>
 as its assessment requirement, 
 which in turn requires 
 <express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.shape_data_quality_upper_value_limit"/>
  as the threshold.
</note><note number="2">
4 instances shown in Figure F.4 depict units used in general. 
If no other unit is specified for specific criterion or measurement requirement, these units are applied.
</note><note number="3">
 Management information such as creator of the criterion and the creation date and time can be attached to 
 <express_ref linkend="product_data_quality_definition_schema:ir_express:product_data_quality_definition_schema.data_quality_definition"/>.
 Since representation of this kind of management information depends on each application protocol using ISO 10303-59, 
 these instances are not shown in this example.

Additionally if you need to specify accuracy for measurement, instances for that purpose should be created as

(2) Assurance of quality for 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>.
<p>
The second scenario is assurance of data quality. 
When you are responsible for quality assurance, you may use this type of quality information for representing 
the results of quality inspection against particular product model data. 
To create this type of quality information by the use of ISO 10303-59, 
you should create inspection results with references to both requirements and inspected product data. 
Inspection results shall be created so that each inspection result corresponds to exactly one particular 
criterion specified. 
You shall create each inspection result with the type of report specified by 
 <express_ref linkend="product_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:product_data_quality_criteria_schema.data_quality_report_request"/>.
The entities related to this scenario are as shown in Figure E.3 of Annex E.7.
</p><p>
An example for this scenario presented below is based on the following assumptions; 
</p><ul>
<li>The requirement is to detect edges shorter than or equal to 0. 01mm with the accuracy of 10-5mm and 
to output summary report of the inspection.</li>
<li>The inspection is performed against the shape data of a product model. 
The ID of the product model is P#319 and the ID of the shape representation is P#304.</li>
<li>As the result of inspection, 24 edges are inspected and 2 edges are found to be within the given threshold. 
The length of the shortest edge detected is 0.009mm. 
The accuracy actually applied to this inspection is 10-5mm for this criterion. 
The general accuracy applied is 10-3mm.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The instances to be created for this scenario are as shown in Figures F.8, F.9, F.10, F.11, F.12 and F.13. 
</p><note>
Instances without circumscribed broken lines are not created with entities from this part of ISO 10303: 
examples are 
<express_ref linkend="product_definition_schema:ir_express:product_definition_schema.product_definition"/>
and 
<express_ref linkend="product_property_representation_schema:ir_express:product_property_representation_schema.shape_representation"/>
of inspected product in Figure F.11. 
Identifiers for these instances are shown with prefix 'P' such as 'product_definition P#319'.

(3) Quality information for use in the improvement of quality for 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>.
<p>
The last scenario is data quality information to be used in quality improvement. 
This scenario assumes that the detailed information obtained for detecting 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>.
by a PDQ checking system will be used in the later stage for healing problem data by the use of some 
PDQ healing system, or by manual work. 
PDQ checking system is required to generate the information on what quality defect is detected to 
what extent and provide it as a detailed inspection result report at the geometric entity instance level. 
Inspection result shall be created for each measurement identifying quality defects detected. 
</p>
An example for this scenario presented below is based on the following assumptions;
<ul>
<li>The requirement is to detect edges shorter than or equal to 0.01mm with the accuracy of 10-5mm. </li>
<li>For the purpose of this scenario, it is necessary to generate the report showing the edges that 
are shorter in length than or equal to 0.01mm and their measured length. 
The reports should be created in extremity order.</li>
<li>The summary report is the same as the example in (2). </li>
<li>The detailed information on the two edges that are detected as short_length_edge is as follows.</li>
<li>edge_curve #86 has the length 0.009mm.</li>
<li>edge_curve #88 has the length 0.009mm.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The instances to be created for this scenario are shown in Figures F.14, F.15, F.16, F.17, F.18, F.19  and F.20.

<b><i>F.3  Instances for 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.gap_between_edge_and_base_surface"/>
</i></b>
<p>
The next example concerns with the 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.gap_between_edge_and_base_surface"/>
 criterion. 
If this criterion is assigned as a concern, PDQ checking system shall inspect every 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.edge_curve"/>s
which bounds a 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface"/>
of the target shape model, calculate the maximum value of the minimum distance 
from any point on the 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.edge_curve"/>s
under inspection to the underlying surface, and detect all the 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.edge_curve"/>s
with the calculated value larger than the specified threshold. 
The definition of the entity 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.gap_between_edge_and_base_surface"/>
is shown in 7.4.99.
</p><p>
For requirement/declaration of quality and for assurance of quality, examples are omitted, 
as they are similar to the previous example for the criterion 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_criteria_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_criteria_schema.short_length_edge"/>.
Example instances are shown only for the scenario of data quality information to be used in quality improvement. 
</p><p>
An example for this scenario presented below is based on the following assumptions;
</p>
<ul>
<li> The requirement is to detect gaps larger than or equal to 0.01mm with the accuracy of 10-5mm. </li>
<li>The requirement on report is: 1) to identify faces that has a gap larger than or equal to 0.01mm between its bounding edges and the underlying surface, 2) to identify pairs of the point on the edge and the point on the base surface where distance between them is within the given threshold, and 3) reports should be created in extremity order.</li> 
<li> The inspection is performed against the shape data of a product model. 
The ID of the product model is P#319 and the ID of the shape representation is P#304.</li>
<li>The summary report has the following contents as the result of inspection: 
66 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface"/>s
are inspected and one 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface"/>
is found to have a gap within the given threshold. The length of the gap is 0.013mm. </li>
<li>The detailed information on the 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface"/>
that is detected to have a large gap between its bounding 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.edge_curve"/>s is: 
The gap is detected on the 
<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface"/>
P#43 between 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_inspection_result_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_inspection_result_schema.point_on_edge_curve"/>
Q# 157 and 
<express_ref linkend="shape_data_quality_inspection_result_schema:ir_express:shape_data_quality_inspection_result_schema.point_on_face_surface"/>
Q#155 and its value is 0.013mm.</li>
</ul>
<note>
Instances circumscribed with broken lines are created with this part of standard. 
ID for these instances is shown with prefix 'Q' such as 'point_on_face_surface Q#21'.
