   <introduction>
   		<p>
   		The subjects of the <b>representation_schema</b> are the structures that relate a collection of elements of product data to a context.
   		These structures are representations.
   		Representations are used to describe aspects of products.
   		The associations between representations and the aspects of products they describe are specified 
   		in annotated EXPRESS schemas that use or specialize this schema.
   		Representations can be used to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			describe a property or a relationship between two properties, in which the properties are associated 
			with a complete product or with a part of a product;
			<note number="1">
				The use of representations to collect elements of product data in order to describe the properties of a
				product is specified in ISO 10303-41, and can be specified in annotated EXPRESS schemas that use or
				specialize the constructs specified in this part of ISO 10303 and in ISO 10303-41.
			</note>
			</li>
			<li>
			describe a picture.
			<note number="2">
				The use of representations to collect elements of product data in order to describe a picture of a
				product is specified in ISO 10303-46, and can be specified in annotated EXPRESS schemas that use or

		<p>One representation can be part of another representation.</p>

   </introduction>
   
   <fund_cons>
   		<b><i>Representation</i></b>
   		<p>The following concepts and assumptions apply to the portions of this schema that deal with representation:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>
   			A representation consists of a collection of elements of representation and a context.
   			A representation corresponds to an instance of the 
   			<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation"/> 
   			entity data type.
   			By structuring the elements in this way, relationships between elements can be established.
   			Elements of representation are related if:
   				<ol>
   					<li>they are elements in the same representation, or</li>
   					<li>they are elements in different representations that have the same context, or</li>
   					<li>they are elements in different representations that have different contexts, if the contexts are related</li>
   				</ol>
   			<example number="1">
   				Consider two points with coordinate values of (0,0,0) and (1,0,0).
   				It is not possible to calculate the distance between these points until it is established that they are in the same coordinate space.
   				The specification of a point by itself does not contain enough data to state which coordinate space it is in and what
				other elements also share that coordinate space.
				In this part of ISO 10303, a point is an example of an element of representation, and a coordinate space is an example of a context.
   			</example>
   			</li>
   			<li>
   			A representation can be used more than once. A representation is separate from its use.
   			<example number="2">
   				Consider a collection of points and lines in a coordinate space.
   				This collection can be used to describe the shape of a product.
   				The collection can also be used, possibly with some transformation, to describe
				a drawing or picture of the product. 
				Neither of these uses is part of the definition of the collection itself.
   			</example>
   			</li>
   		</ul>
   		<note>
   			Representations can be specialized further in annotated EXPRESS schemas that use or specialize this schema.
   		</note>
   		
   		<b><i>Context of representation</i></b>
   		<p>The following assumptions apply to the portions of this schema that deal with the context of representation:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>
   				A representation has a context. 
   				It is the context in which the elements of the representation are related.
   				The context of a representation corresponds to an instance of the 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation_context"/>
				entity data type.
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				The context of a representation exists only as a basis for the representations that use it. 
   				Therefore, representation contexts are related only if representations using the contexts are related.
   			</li>
   		</ul>
   		<note>
   			Representation contexts can be specialized further in annotated EXPRESS schemas that use or specialize this schema.
   		</note>
   		<example>
   			Possible specializations include contexts for geometry, topology, finite element modelling and kinematic modelling.
   		</example>
   		
   		<b><i>Elements of representation</i></b>
   		<p>The following concepts and assumptions apply to the portions of this schema that deal with elements of representation:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>
   				Elements of representation participate directly in a representation, or support the definition of 
   				another element of representation, or both.
   				<example number="1">
   					A point could be the only element in the representation of the location of a product, or it could
					serve as the end point of a line that is the only element in the representation of the edge of a product. 
					In the first case the point itself is an element in a representation directly.
					In the second case, the point serves only to provide definition for the line entity.
   				</example>
   				<example number="2">
   					An element of representation that specifies the presentation of a text string could be part of the description of a drawing. 
   					In this case it participates directly in a representation. 
   					The same element of representation could, alternatively, be part of a dimension callout. 
   					In this second case the text is part of the callout, and participates indirectly in the description of the drawing.
   				</example>
   				<note>
   					Elements of representation that describe the presentation of text strings are specified in ISO 10303-46. 
   					Elements of representation that describe dimension callouts are described in ISO 10303-101.
   				</note>
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				Elements of representation can refer to each other, thereby forming graphs of such elements in
				which each graph has an identifiable root.
				The association of a root element with a context associates all elements in the graph with the context.
				<example number="3">
					A curve is defined by a number of points. 
					These points are all in the same coordinate space as the curve by virtue of their reference from the curve.
				</example>
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				Elements of representation are collected into representations and associated with contexts as a
				basis for establishing relationships between elements.
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				An element of representation corresponds to an instance of the 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation_item"/> 
   				entity data type.
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				An association of one or more elements of representation with a context corresponds to an
				instance of the 
				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation"/> 
				entity data type.
   			</li>
   		</ul>
   		
   		<b><i>Association of representations</i></b>
   		<p>The following concepts and assumptions apply to the portions of this schema that deal with the association of representations:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>A representation can be related to another representation.</li>
   			<li>
   				One representation can be related to another representation such that they both participate in the
				association, but one does not define the other.
				This type of association corresponds to the 
				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation_relationship"/> 
				entity data type.
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				One representation can be related to another representation such that the first is part of the definition of the second.
   				This type of association corresponds to the 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.mapped_item"/> 
   				and 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation_map"/> 
   				entity data types.
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				Two collections of representation elements can be unrelated in two separate contexts, and yet be
				related in a third context, or be related only as they both participate in a relating structure.
   			</li>
   		</ul>
   		<example>
   			Two collections of points and lines each represent the shape of a part. 
   			Each of those shapes exists in a separate context independent and completely unrelated to the other.
   			A third context can exist for the shape of an assembly of which these parts are components.
   			In this third context, all of the elements are related, either
			through a direct association of those elements with that context, or through an association of the representations
			of the parts with the representation of the assembly.
   		</example>
   		
   		<b><i>Transformation</i></b>
   		<p>The following concepts and assumptions apply to the portions of this schema that deal with transformations:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>
   				Elements in different representations can be compared if
   				<ol>
   					<li>the representations have the same context, or</li>
   					<li>a transformation is defined that relates the representations to each other.</li>
   				</ol>
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				A transformation can be defined as a function f between a domain A and a range B.
   				The function f:A->B takes each element a in A and maps it to an element b in B, i.e., f(a)=b.
   				The complete specification of a transformation requires the following:
   				<ol>
   					<li>the set of elements a to be transformed;</li>
   					<li>the set of elements b resulting from the transformations;</li>
   					<li>the definition of the context A that is common to the set of elements a;</li>
   					<li>the definition of the context B that is common to the set of elements b;</li>
   					<li>the function f.</li>
   				</ol>
   				The domain A and the range B are instances of the 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation_context"/> 
   				entity data type.
   				The elements a and b are instances of the 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation_item"/> 
   				entity data type.
   				The relationships between a and A, and between b and B, are instances of the 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation"/> 
   				entity data type: a is an element in a representation whose context is A, b is an element in a representation whose
				context is B.
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				Two different approaches are used in this part of ISO 10303 to specify transformations.
   				<ol>
   					<li>
   						The function f can be specified. 
   						This type of transformation corresponds to the 
   						<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.functionally_defined_transformation"/> 
   						entity data type.
   						<example number="1">
   							Two representations are related such that one is rotated and skewed with respect to the other.
							This transformation can be specified by a matrix.
   						</example>
   						<note number="1">
   							The data structures for particular kinds of transformation functions, such as matrices, are not
							specified in this part of ISO 10303.
   						</note>
   						<example number="2">
   							Points on a map are related to points on the surface of the earth by a function that transforms the
							three dimensional surface to a two dimensional picture, and applies a scaling factor.
   						</example>
   					</li>
   					<li>
   						An element a in context A and an element b in context B that are sufficient to derive the
						function can be specified.
						This type of transformation corresponds to the
						<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.item_defined_transformation"/>
						entity data type, or to the mapping defined by the
						<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.mapped_item"/> 
						entity data type.
						<example number="3">
							A translation between coordinate spaces can be uniquely determined by two instances of
							<express_ref linkend="geometry_schema:ir_express:geometry_schema.axis2_placement_3d"/> 
							a1 and b1 (one in each coordinate space), such that f takes a1 and transforms it to b1.
						</example>
						<note number="2">
							The 
							<express_ref linkend="geometry_schema:ir_express:geometry_schema.axis2_placement_3d"/> 
							entity data type is defined in ISO 10303-42.
						</note>
   					</li>
   				</ol>
   			</li>
   		</ul>
   		
   		<b><i>Uncertainty</i></b>
   		<p>
   			Numeric values that are measured or calculated can be imprecise.
   			Uncertainty is a measure of the interval of confidence associated with this imprecision.
   			In this International Standard, uncertainty can be specified for:
   		</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>multiple representations that share a common context;</li>
   			<li>individual representations;</li>
   			<li>individual elements of representation.</li>
   		</ul>
   		<p>This part of ISO 10303 supports (a) and (b).</p>
   		<note number="1">(c) is supported by ISO 10303-45 [5].</note>
   		<note number="2">
	   		Uncertainty is unrelated to the subject of tolerances or permitted variations. 
	   		These are supported by ISO 10303-47 [7].
   		</note>
   		<p>The following concepts and assumptions apply to the portions of this schema that deal with uncertainty:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>
   				The uncertainty for numeric values can be specified for all the representations that share a context.
   				This is specified using the 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.global_uncertainty_assigned_context"/> 
   				entity data type.
   			</li>
   			<li>
   				The uncertainty for numeric values can be specified for a representation in a given context.
   				This is specified using the 
   				<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.uncertainty_assigned_representation"/>  
   				entity data type.
   			</li>
   		</ul>
   		<p>
   			If uncertainties are specified more than once, the following precedence rules shall apply.
   			The uncertainty specified for an individual element of representation shall have precedence over the uncertainty specified by any
   			<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.uncertainty_assigned_representation"/> 
   			in which the item participates.
   			The uncertainty specified by an
   			<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.uncertainty_assigned_representation"/> 
   			shall have precedence over the uncertainty specified by any
   			<express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.global_uncertainty_assigned_context"/>
   			in which the representation participates.
   		</p>
   		<note number="3">
   			Uncertainty for an individual element of representation is specified by the
   			<express_ref linkend="qualified_measure_schema:ir_express:qualified_measure_schema.qualified_representation_item"/>
