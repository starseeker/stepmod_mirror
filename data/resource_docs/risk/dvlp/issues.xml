There is an overall lack of identifying individual risks or risk versions stemming from an initial or baseline risk 
analysis for use in the the overall risk assessment process.

It has been recommended to look into having risk be a type of product.  This will inherently add versioning capability, which would help with historical risk, initial risk, residual risk, etc.

Excerpt from an email dated 03-11-07 from Ian Bailey:  As we discussed in Poitiers, there is a strong case for making risk a subtype of product - this came about due to the necessary to manage versions of risk analysis. The rest of the Risk module seems to fall broadly into two categories - relationship entities and properties. This would map nicely into the existing IRs if Risk was a subtype of product. Also, I notice that 'Risk_perception' would then map nicely to product_view_definition.

Use of role entities for risk_criteria_role, risk_impact_role, risk_probability_role, and possibly risk_source_role may not be needed for all assignment entities.

Will consider using a NOTE for assignment entities.

Where are derived risks, particularly cost and time totals placed in the model?  In other words, the summing up the individual risks to obtain a monetary value.  Is this done in the application?

  <description>
In most domains, consequence and impact are used synonymously.  The model needs to justify the existence of two distinct entities of risk_consequence and risk_impact.

<description>
From Poitiers it was noted that the availability of numerical ranges for risk_impact was essential.  In addition, cost, time, activities and products inside and/or outside the system plus their states and properties may all be impacted.

It would be interesting how to include the impacted 'environment' that lies outside the system boundary.

<description>
If impact is described as 'chain of causality' or the next consequence, consequence/impact relationships would be required.  Consequential relationships are currently not represented.

  <description>
Risk criteria may be inappropriately addressing its intended usage.  In some domains, risk criteria is a document checklist which helps to define how to define the problem or helps in prioritizing or in acting as a stimilus for brainstorming.

The name risk_criteria implies the plural form of criterion.  Which is it that should be represented?

If risk_treatment is a process, then the result of this process should perhaps be called risk_treatment_result.

  <description>
Residual_risk is a form of risk_relationship.  This supports the use of a view definition using risk_view_definition, for example.  Furthermore, the risk assessment life cycle can be better represented using risk_view_definition context attribute.
