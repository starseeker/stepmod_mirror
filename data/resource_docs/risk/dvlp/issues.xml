There is an overall lack of identifying individual risks or risk versions stemming from an initial or baseline risk 
analysis for use in the the overall risk assessment process.

It has been recommended to look into having risk be a type of product.  This will inherently add versioning capability, which would help with historical risk, initial risk, residual risk, etc.

Excerpt from an email dated 03-11-07 from Ian Bailey:  As we discussed in Poitiers, there is a strong case for making risk a subtype of product - this came about due to the necessary to manage versions of risk analysis. The rest of the Risk module seems to fall broadly into two categories - relationship entities and properties. This would map nicely into the existing IRs if Risk was a subtype of product. Also, I notice that 'Risk_perception' would then map nicely to product_view_definition.

From Poitiers it was noted that the availability of numerical ranges for risk_impact was essential.  In addition, cost, time, activities and products inside and/or outside the system plus their states and properties may all be impacted.

Residual_risk is a form of risk_relationship.  This supports the use of a view definition using risk_view_definition, for example.  Furthermore, the risk assessment life cycle can be better represented using risk_view_definition context attribute.

By subtyping representation, a set of representation items (label) are collected for use as a

Suggest to keep the risk_impact as a separate subtype as it allows impact of something, the environment, 
or another product, or even new activities to be the result of.  The context of the risk_impact can
be stated as representation_context.

Date_time_schema has event_occurrence that may be used instead of an abstract 
supertype assigned_probability_assignment.  Assignment of event_occurrence is
found in management_resources_schema.

There is no capability for ask consulting bodies for their input.  
Possibly give an example of a stakeholder such as NGO (Non-governmental organization).

Added examples for organization, person, and person in organization.  
Risk_communication allows the flow of any risk element from one stakeholder to one or more stakeholders.

The definition of risk does not correspond to the introduction.  For complex risk management
systems, there may be other consequences, non-related events, etc.

In order to classify the risk elements indicated, a context or a role is needed.  Propose to 
include a note indicating that classification_role is inherited from classification assignment.

Probability distributions should have a note indicating that it is a subtype of representation

There is currently no means to compare apples to apples since risk criteria is not 
related at all to risk_perception.  In risk module (1264) however there is an 
applied risk criteria assignment where risk perception can be selected.

Risk_criteria is now a sub-type of risk_perception, thus allowing the comparison 
of acceptance criteria to estimates from a risk analysis.

The risk_estimation_select selects the entities that require the actual estimates.
With the exception of distribution, should not this select point directly to the
required values, string or numeric?

Input to the risk estimation is rather risk_context, lessons_learned, etc., while 
the risk_evaluation is the process of comparing risk (risk_perception) and criteria.

Removed input from evaluation and included risk_perception_context.  The risk_context 
was not chosen as it is applicable to base risk only.  All actions such as estimations
are done with risk_perception.  Should lessons learned be included?  How about resources?
