     The aspects of risk management, whether positive or negative, that
     result in an opportunity for benefit or threat to it succeeding
     are included.

     The risk_schema identifies risks as they are perceived each with their

   <introduction>
<p>The risk_schema identifies a risk by specifying the potential for realization of unwanted negative consequences of an event. 
   A risk is accounted by the existence of general uncertainty and feared events.  
</p>   
<note number="1">A risk associated with general uncertainty is refered to as <i>unknown unknowns</i></note>
<note number="2">A risk of feared events is refered to as <i>known unknowns</i></note>
<p>The identification of a risk can describe the concern at hand which may be related to more than one event 
with more than one possible outcome or consequence.
</p>
<example>Project Bravo has entered Phase II with a major subsystem functioning in Mode Number 5.  
</example>

<p>As risk is always present, more than one perception of a risk is possible.  
The representaion of a risk_perception describes a risk in a particular context along 
with the probability of an event and its corresponding consequence or consequences.
</p>

<p>A risk is not limited to events but may apply to products, people, organizations, 
or to other items of interest, as defined by Application Protocols or Modules 
that use this resource part that have the potential for generating risks of general uncertainty.
</p>
</introduction>
<fund_cons>
<p>A <express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk"/> 
can be determinately identifed by a set of recognisable assessments or perceptions 
that can be used to distinguish all relevant possible outcomes.  
</p>

<p>
In this part of ISO 10303 such a perception is recorded as an instance of the 
<express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk_perception"/> entity. 
</p>
<note>
A <express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk_perception"/> is susceptible to reassessment over time. 
</note>

<p>Providing meaningful value for an assessment requires that a comparison be made against predetermined standards or criteria 
to which a value-based judgement or decision point can be made.  The evaluation of such an assessment is represented by 
<express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk_evaluation"/>.  
</p>
<p>
As action is taken to change one or more aspects of a 
<express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk"/>, the 
<express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk_reduction"/> 
select <express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk_reduction.resolves"/> 
those risk data elements that have been chosen for such a change.  
</p>
<p>Based on the <express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk_reduction.approach"/> or method of 
<express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk_treatment"/>,
the change may involve a risk data element to be lessened in its likelihood of occurring, reduction of its consequence, 
or other distinctive element that would result in a reassessment of a 
<express_ref linkend="risk_schema:ir_express:risk_schema.risk_perception.risk"/>.
