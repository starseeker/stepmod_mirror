    This part of ISO 10303 supports the dimensioning and tolerancing methods defined by the ISO 1101
    family of standards for the dimensions and tolerances on engineering drawings. 
    This part captures the semantic contents of the dimensions and tolerances as specified in 
    those standards and applies them to three-dimensional geometric models.

   <introduction>
	<p>
	   	The subject of the <b>shape_aspect_definition_schema</b> is to provide definitions of the spatial characteristics of 
	   	a shape that are required for dimensioning and tolerancing.
	   	This schema provides representations for a <b>derived_shape_aspect</b> and a <b>datum</b>.
	   	A <b>derived_shape_aspect</b> is a <b>shape_aspect</b> that is developed from the defined
		shape of the product, but that is not required for defining the product shape.
		A <b>datum</b> is a <b>shape_aspect</b> that provide the origin from where dimensions and tolerances are referenced.
		A <b>derived_shape_aspect</b> and a <b>datum</b> are aspects of the shape that are required for dimensioning and 
		tolerancing the size, the location, the orientation, and the form of a product shape.
	</p>
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
	<p>
   		The product shape is the concept of shape as a property that characterizes a product.
   		Geometric models and engineering drawings are formal methods used to represent the product shape.
   		Dimensions and tolerances are elements of the product shape definition which are independent from how the shape is represented.
   		Dimensions may be explicitly identified as part of the shape characteristics, implicitly included in a geometric model that
		represents the shape, or explicitly presented in a two-dimensional drawing.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <b>shape_aspect</b> is an element of a product shape.
		Dimensions may be specified for both the entire product shape and aspects of the shape.
		This schema augments the <b>shape_aspect</b>s and the relationships among them as the definitional mechanism 
		for specifying dimensions and tolerances.
		A <b>shape_aspect</b>, relationships between <b>shape_aspect</b> elements, and their specified dimensions and tolerances are 
		always defined in the context of the product shape property. 
		These dimensions and tolerances can be represented as elements of geometric models or engineering drawings.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the purpose of identifying dimensions and tolerances, this schema specifies the concept of a derived <b>shape_aspect</b>.
		A derived <b>shape_aspect</b> is a <b>shape_aspect</b> that is defined based on the specific way in which it relates
		to another shape aspect.
		The derived <b>shape_aspect</b> is used in conjunction with their related <b>shape_aspect</b> elements to specify 
		dimensions and tolerances.
		The specific geometry that can represent the derived <b>shape_aspect</b> and a <b>shape_aspect</b> that provide 
		the definitional relationship are not in the scope of this schema.
		The geometry, the representation structure, and their association to the dimension and tolerance elements specified
		in this part are defined in IS0 10303-41, IS0 10303-42, and IS0 10303-43.
		Only the generic concept of derived <b>shape_aspect</b> is specified here.
		Application protocols may specify additional derived <b>shape_aspect</b> elements from those provided.
	</p>
	<note>
		Legal values that are computer sensible for attributes of entities in this schema may be specified in application protocols.

		The <b>shape_dimension_schema</b> provides a representation for the description of location and size dimensions.

   		The decision as to whether the dimensional location is directed or non-directed is specified in an application protocol.

   	<p>
   		A dimension is applied along a specific measuring path.

	<introduction>
		<p>
			The <b>shape_tolerance_schema</b> provides the constructs for describing tolerances that apply to dimensions 
			and to elements of <b>shape_aspect</b>.
			This schema includes two types of tolerance: plus-minus tolerance and geometrical tolerance.
			The plus-minus tolerance provides the constructs for specifying tolerances in one of two ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the specification of upper and lower limits within which a dimension may vary;</li>
			<li>the specification of limits and fits as specified in IS0 286-l and IS0 286-2.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The representation of statistical tolerance may be associated with the direct specification of the upper and the lower limits 
			of the plus-minus tolerance or with a geometric tolerance.
		</p>
		<p>
			The geometrical tolerance provides the constructs for applying tolerance zones to elements of <b>shape_aspects</b>.
			A tolerance zone defines a region or an area within which a <b>shape_aspect</b> may vary and is bounded by a set of
			tolerance zone elements.
			These constructs support tolerances for the form, orientation, location, profile, and runout of a <b>shape_aspect</b>.
			A tolerance zone may be represented by specific geometry and is used for various tolerancing methods.
		</p>
	</introduction>
	<fund_cons>
		<p>
			A toleranced dimension is an exact dimension with a plus-minus tolerance.
			A plus-minus tolerance limits the dimensional variation of a dimension of a product.
			The plus-minus tolerance range is limited by either assigned values, which define the upper bound and lower bound of a dimension, 
			or a standard tolerance as specified in IS0 286-l and IS0 286-2.
			The tolerance with a statistical distribution provides an additional specification of the variation of a dimension and 
			may be used with either a plus-minus tolerance or a geometric tolerance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Geometrical tolerances constrain the variations in the geometric properties of a product shape.
			These properties are form, location, orientation, profile, and runout.
			IS0 1101 specifies geometrical tolerances for form, location, orientation, profile, and runout.
			IS0 5458 specifies the geometrical tolerance for position.
			A limit condition modifies a geometrical tolerance such that the size variation of a <b>shape_aspect</b> may increase or decrease, 
			as specified in IS0 2692.
			A geometrical tolerance has a tolerance zone that defines the limits of the variation of a <b>shape_aspect</b>.
			Tolerance zone elements defme the boundaries of a geometrical tolerance zone.
			The tolerance zone for a single <b>shape_aspect</b> may be defined as a single zone or in increments that are contiguous 
			with a defined unit or by length or area.
			The size of the tolerance zone is defined by the measure of the tolerance.
			Tolerance zones for geometrical tolerances are specified in IS0 1101 and 5458.
		</p>
		<p>
			A geometrical tolerance may reference a <b>datum</b> system which is composed of one or more <b>datum</b>s.
			The <b>datum</b> system defines an origin for the geometrical properties.
		</p>
		<note number="1">
			When the tolerance zone is not fully bounded, it is appropriate to assume that the tolerance zone extends to infinity
			at the unbounded areas
		</note>
		<note number="2">
			Legal values that are computer sensible for attributes of entities in this schema may be specified in application protocols.
		</note>
		<example number="19">
			A flatness tolerance zone of a planar surface is bounded by two parallel, infinite planes separated 
			by a distance of the tolerance magnitude.
		</example>
