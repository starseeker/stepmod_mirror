There are two entities 'sharing' the same shortname at the moment.  This occured during 
the shortname generation where two express files, one for each schema, were uploaded.
    shortname name="STT0" entity="state_assessment"
    shortname name="STT0" entity="state_type_role"

<description>
 this is necessary in Part 56, given  the use of the state_predicted subtype in the state_observed modules.  In distinguishing "type" from "individual" and "planned" from "realized" state behaves like activity, rather than product.</description>

<description>
Strengthen definitional nature.  Suggest first section is changed to read: A state type captures some unique aspect or aspects that identify and characterise a potential observed state to which reference needs to be made.  A state type defines a state that an individual item may be observed or predicted to possess for a period of time.   Different individuals may by in the state defined by a state type for different time periods, some of which may overlap. When the characteristics defined by the state type are present the item is said to be in that state.  
 
Third para, second and third sentence: change to read "A state type may be related to another state type by a cause and effect relationship, where one state type causes or results from another. State types may also be related as a sequence, through which one state type may transition into another state type.  The nature of the relationship between two state types is defined by the description attribute on the state_type_relationship entity.
 
Final sentence to read:  Data recording the predicted or observed existance of an individual in a state are the subject of the state_observed_schema.

<description>
Suggest reword first sentence to read :  An observed state represents the existence of an individual item, for a period of time, when it is observed, or predicted to possess recognisable characteristics that may not be present at a different time. The characteristics that describe an observed state may be recorded in the description attribute of the observed_state entity, or by reference to relevant state_types using the state_assertion or state_assessment entities.
 
Second para, from second sentence: change to read: This reflects the diagnosis process where something may be observed or predicted to be in an abnormal state before the precise cause, and hence state type, is known.  A general state type may be asserted initially. As investigations proceed other, more precise, state types can be associated as assessed states. Other state types can be asserted as not applying.

Cover page is missing the CD copyright statement from the Supplementary Directives. There are words missing on the comments to readers (should say " ready for this ballot cycle" as opposed to "for"
 
 
Foreword mentions an optional Annex E - where is it? There only appears to be A-D.

Clause titles: h2 for level 1, h3 for level 2, etc.
Why? It does not say anything about this in the HTML guidelines
Make them all h2

Move the a copyright notice to a separate page after the Cover page.
Do you mean the copyright on the contents page?
Add a copyright link in the Table of contents block after the Table f contents entry

  <p>Ballot comment</p>
  <p>Terms such as "State" are engrained in various domains, often with domain-specific meaning. To facilitate reuse across domains, these terms and their definitions should be as generic as possible. Domain-specific interpretation is achieved in individual AM's.
Rationale: The use of the term "condition" which itself can take on the meaning of "state", makes this a circular definition.  Also, the implicit inclusion of time, "does or could exist" (what about "did exist"). Is viewed as an unnecessary constraint for this definition.
  </p>
    <p>
    Replace definition: "The condition in which something does or could exist"
With the definition "Mode of being"

  <p>The schema uses extensible selects which are not used elsewhere in the integrated resources. These are used in assignment-entities which so far have been modelled as management resources in ISO 10303-41.
  
  </p>
    <p>
Apply the same style to assignment-entities as is currently in the integrated resources.

  The assignment-entities in the two schemas use attributes "item_set". This does not conform to the style in ISO 10303.

  Rename the attributes "item_set" to "items".
If the previous comment is followed, this comment will be obsolete as the items-attribute would then be removed.

    Clause 4 examples added.
      </p>
    <p>
EXAMPLE 1   An inspection process measures the length of a crack, and declares the part to be "defective". A second process replaces parts that are "defective". 
  </p>
    <p>
EXAMPLE 2   A quality control process defines the allowable variance between an independent laboratory's test result of a product and the product's specification limit, and judges the quality of the product to be out of specification or "off-spec". A second process rejects products that are "off-spec". 
  </p>

    <p>
    Clause 5 examples added.
      </p>
    <p>
EXAMPLE 1   Main Engine Fuel Pump No. 1 is in the phase of "injection". 
  </p>
    <p>
EXAMPLE 2   A hydrogen atom can be "excited" or "decayed". 
  </p>
    <p>
EXAMPLE 3   A particular system of atoms will be at "thermal equilibrium" later but not now, or at a certain temperature. 
  </p>
    <p>
EXAMPLE 4   After my portable computer displayed a "low-battery" warning, I immediately attached its power supply.

  The style of definitions does not conform to ISO 10303, both in style and contents.
Example:
ascribed_state: This attribute identifies the ascribed state observed.

    <p>
  Change definitions to be compliant with the Suplementary Directives. Provide definitions that do more than just repeat the name of the concept.
