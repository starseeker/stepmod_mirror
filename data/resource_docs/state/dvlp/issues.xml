There are two entities 'sharing' the same shortname at the moment.  This occured during 
the shortname generation where two express files, one for each schema, were uploaded.
    shortname name="STT0" entity="state_assessment"
    shortname name="STT0" entity="state_type_role"

<description>
 this is necessary in Part 56, given  the use of the state_predicted subtype in the state_observed modules.  In distinguishing "type" from "individual" and "planned" from "realized" state behaves like activity, rather than product.</description>

Strengthen definitional nature.  Suggest first section is changed to read: A state type captures some unique aspect or aspects that identify and characterise a potential observed state to which reference needs to be made.  A state type defines a state that an individual item may be observed or predicted to possess for a period of time.   Different individuals may by in the state defined by a state type for different time periods, some of which may overlap. When the characteristics defined by the state type are present the item is said to be in that state.  
 
Third para, second and third sentence: change to read "A state type may be related to another state type by a cause and effect relationship, where one state type causes or results from another. State types may also be related as a sequence, through which one state type may transition into another state type.  The nature of the relationship between two state types is defined by the description attribute on the state_type_relationship entity.
 
Final sentence to read:  Data recording the predicted or observed existance of an individual in a state are the subject of the state_observed_schema.

<description>
Suggest reword first sentence to read :  An observed state represents the existence of an individual item, for a period of time, when it is observed, or predicted to possess recognisable characteristics that may not be present at a different time. The characteristics that describe an observed state may be recorded in the description attribute of the observed_state entity, or by reference to relevant state_types using the state_assertion or state_assessment entities.
 
Second para, from second sentence: change to read: This reflects the diagnosis process where something may be observed or predicted to be in an abnormal state before the precise cause, and hence state type, is known.  A general state type may be asserted initially. As investigations proceed other, more precise, state types can be associated as assessed states. Other state types can be asserted as not applying.

Cover page is missing the CD copyright statement from the Supplementary Directives. There are words missing on the comments to readers (should say " ready for this ballot cycle" as opposed to "for"

Clause titles: h2 for level 1, h3 for level 2, etc.
Why? It does not say anything about this in the HTML guidelines
Make them all h2
Title h1

Move the a copyright notice to a separate page after the Cover page.
Do you mean the copyright on the contents page?
Add a copyright link in the Table of contents block after the Table f contents entry

The Resource HTML is now the same as the Module HTML. The copyright has an
entry in the table of contents block. The copyright notice appears at the end of
the table of contents page.

Superscripts overlap dashes.  Use a em dash followed by the superscripted number.  Use em dashes to connect components of a standard title (between "Industrial automation systems and integration" and "Product data representation and exchange").
Will be raised as a Ballot comment
