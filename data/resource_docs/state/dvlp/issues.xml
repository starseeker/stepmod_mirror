Shouldn't there be a definition of the term state so that it can be referenced in the module?

There are two entities 'sharing' the same shortname at the moment.  This occured during 
the shortname generation where two express files, one for each schema, were uploaded.
    shortname name="STT0" entity="state_assessment"
    shortname name="STT0" entity="state_type_role"

Re-registered both express files as one express file and easily obtained unique names.
