 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
	   The <b>state_type_schema</b> identifies a type of state by specifying the criterium that shall be satisified 
	   for something  to be in a state of that type. For example, a state might be defined by the presence 
	   of an identified fault in a product.
   </p>
   <p>
	   The <b>state_observed_schema</b> identifies an observed state, which may be either predicted or actual, 
	   and enabling it to linked to the thing or things that are in the state. An observed state represents a period
	   of time when the criterium defining the state type either are or will be satisfied for one or more items. 
	   Actual observed states therefore correspond to a period in the life of something. 
	   States are not limited to products but may apply to activities, people, and organizations.
   </p>

	<p>
		A state represents the existence of something 
		over a period of time when it exhibits some characteristic that can 
		be identified and is distinct from other periods when that same characteristic does not apply. 
		The characteristics define a type of state and are defined using data types specified in the 
		state_type_schema. 
	</p>
	<p>
		States may be specified that are composed of multiple sub-states. They may be related by cause and effect 
		when one state causes another.
