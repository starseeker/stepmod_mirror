 <!-- Introduction -->
 <!-- The introduction should start as shown: -->
 <purpose>
   <p>
	   The state_type_schema identifies a type of state by specifying the criteria that shall be satisified 
	   for something to be in a state of that type. 
</p><example>A state is defined by the presence 
	   of an identified fault in a product.</example>
   <p>
	   The state_observed_schema identifies an observed state 
   and the link to the thing or things that are in the state. 
	  
	   Observed states may correspond to a period in the life of product data 
	   when the criteria defining the state type either are or will be satisfied. 
	   States are not limited to products but may apply to activities, people, and organizations.
	   
	   An observed state records that one or more items were in a defined state_type for a part of their life.  
	   The item to which an observed state applies is determined by using applied_state_assignment. 
	   An observed state may apply to products, activities, people, organizations or to other items of interest, 
	   as defined by Application Protocols or Modules that use this resource part.

    <def>a state of being.  All possible states of an item are types of state, which are  
 identified as a specific state_type's in state_type_schema.  As an item is realized or observed to enter any 
 one of the state_type's, the item acquires an individual state or observed_state in state_observed_schema.

	<introduction>
		The state_type_schema represents the existence of possible states or types of state an individual item may acquire.

	   <p>
		   A state type captures some unique aspect or aspects that identify and characterise 
		   a potential observed state to which reference needs to be made.  A state type defines 
		   a state that an individual item may be observed or predicted to possess for a period 
		   of time.   Different individuals may by in the state defined by a state type for 
		   different time periods, some of which may overlap. When the characteristics defined 
		   by the state type are present the item is said to be in that state.  
	   </p>
	   <p>
		   In this part of ISO 10303 such a state type is recording using the state_type entity.
	   </p>
	<p>
        State types may be specified that are composed of multiple sub-state types. 
        A state type may be related to another state type by a cause and effect relationship, 
        where one state type causes or results from another. State types may also be related 
        as a sequence, through which one state type may transition into another state type.  
        The nature of the relationship between two state types is defined by the description 
        attribute on the state type relationship entity.
	</p>
	   <p>
		   Data recording the predicted or observed existance of an individual in a state are 
		   the subject of the state observed schema.

   <introduction>
   		The state_observed_schema represents the existence of state(s) an individual item is observed to possess at 
   		any point in time.  
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
	<p>
		An observed state represents the existence of an individual item, for a period of 
		time, when it is observed, or predicted to possess recognisable characteristics that 
		may not be present at a different time. The characteristics that describe an observed 
		state may be recorded in the description attribute of the observed_state entity, 
		or by reference to relevant state types using the state assertion or state assessment 
		entities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over time, a given observed state may be associated with multiple state types. 
		This reflects the diagnosis process where something may be observed or predicted 
		to be in an abnormal state before the precise cause, and hence state type, is known.  
		A general state type may be asserted initially. As investigations proceed other, 
		more precise, state types can be associated as assessed states. Other state types 
		can be asserted as not applying.
	</p>
	<p>
		An observed state may have occured, may be current, or may be expected to take 
		place in the future. 
	</p>
	<p>
		An item or a set of items may exist in a state. This fact is captured using the 
		applied state assignment entity.
