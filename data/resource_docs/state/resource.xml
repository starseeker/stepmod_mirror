 <purpose>
   <p>
	   The <b>state_type_schema</b> identifies a type of state by specifying the criteria that shall be satisified 
	   for something to be in a state of that type. 
  </p>
  <example>
       A state is defined by the presence 
	   of an identified fault in a product.
  </example>
  <p>
	   The <b>state_observed_schema</b> identifies an observed state and the link to the thing or things that are 
	   in the state. 
	  
	   Observed states may correspond to a period in the life of product data 
	   when the criteria defining the state type either have been satisfied, are being satisfied, or will be satisfied. 
	   States are not limited to products but may apply to activities, people, and organizations.
	   
	   An observed state records that one or more items were in a defined <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/> for a period of their life.  
	   The item to which an observed state applies is determined by using <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_observed_schema.state_observed_assignment"/>. 
	   An observed state may apply to products, activities, people, organizations or to other items of interest, 
	   as defined by Application Protocols or Modules that use this resource part.

	<introduction>
		The <b>state_type_schema</b> represents the existence of possible states or types of state that an individual item 
		may acquire.
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
	   <p>
   		   A <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/> identifies a set of recognisable characteristics that can be used to distinguish
		   an observed state.  These characteristics specify a mode of being.
           When these characteristics are present for an item, the item is said to be in that state, as 
           represented using <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_observed_schema.state_observed"/>.  
	   </p>	  
           <note>An item may exhibit characteristics that match 
           several <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/>s for a period of time.   
           </note>
	   <p>
		   In this part of ISO 10303 such a state type is recorded as an instance of the <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/> entity.
	   </p>
	<p>
        State types may be specified that are composed of multiple sub-state types.
        A <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/> may be related to another <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/> by a cause and effect relationship, 
        where one <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/> causes or results from another. State types may also be related 
        as a sequence, through which one <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/> may transition into another <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/>.   
        The nature of the relationship between two <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/>s is defined by the role and description 
        attributes of the <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type_relationship"/> entity.
	</p>
	   <p>
		   Data recording the predicted or observed existence of an item in a state are 
		   the subject of the <b>state_observed_schema</b>.

   <introduction>
   		The <b>state_observed_schema</b> represents the existence of state(s) an individual item is observed to possess at 
   		any point in time.  
   </introduction>
   <fund_cons>
	<p>
		A <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_observed_schema.state_observed"/> entity represents the existence of recognisable characteristics for a period of 
		time.  The period of time may historical, current, or predicted.  The characteristics that describe an observed 
		state may be recorded in the description attribute of the <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_observed_schema.state_observed"/> entity, 
		or by reference to relevant <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/>s using the <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_observed_schema.ascribable_state"/> entity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over time, a given observed state may be associated with multiple state types. 
		This reflects the diagnosis process where something may be observed or predicted 
		to be in an abnormal state before the precise cause, and hence <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/>, is known.  
		A <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/> may be assessed initially using the <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_observed_schema.ascribable_state"/> entity. 
		As investigations proceed other, more precise, <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/>s can be associated as 
		asserted states again using the <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_observed_schema.ascribable_state"/> entity.  Other <express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_type_schema.state_type"/>s can be 
		asserted as not applying.
	</p>
	<p>
		An observed state may have occured, may be current, or may be expected to take 
		place in the future.  
	</p>
	<p>		An item or a set of items may exist in a state.  This fact is captured by using the 
		<express_ref linkend="state:ir:state_observed_schema.state_observed_assignment"/> entity data type.
	</p>
		<note>
		The assignment of state to an item or set of items may be meaningful for some process.
