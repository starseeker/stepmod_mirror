A class is a set.

NOTE 1 The term 'set' is defined in clause 3.3. In this part of ISO 10303, 'set' and 'class' are synonyms.

NOTE 2 The meaning of this entity is identical to:

the entity class defined in ISO 10303-214; and 
the entity class defined in ISO 15926-2. 
NOTE 3 A class can consist of all things with a particular set of properties. Hence information about the consequences of possessing the set of properties can be assigned to the class.

If a thing is classified as being a member of such a class, then a set of properties possessed by the thing can be deduced.

NOTE 4 This entity may be instantiated as a compound instance involving another entity from ISO 10303.

NOTE 5 The distinction between a class_by_extension and a class_by_intension can be imprecise. For example, the set of items produced by a particular production run could be regarded as either. The entity type class is not specified as abstract, so an application protocol or application module can decide to ignore the distinction.
