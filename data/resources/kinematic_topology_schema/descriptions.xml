			Using graph theory, the topology of a mechanism is represented by a directed graph, where the links correspond to the nodes, 
			and the joints correspond to the edges.
			This graph can be derived from the definition of the links and joints.
			If the topology of a mechanism is defined only by this minimal information, it is referred to as "lower level topology" 
			within this part of ISO 10303.
		</p>
		<p>
			Graph theory provides a means to capture connectivity information which may be applied to the describe 
			the topological structure of mechanisms.
			The geometrical and mechanical properties are not conveyed.
			If the full topological information including connectivity information is provided explicitly, 
			this is referred to as "higher level topology" within this part of ISO 10303.
		</p>
		<p>
			A general graph may be composed of two basic types of subgraphs:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Trees;</li>
			<li>Networks.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If, in addition to the lower level of topology, the higher level topology is provided in a kinematic model, 
			this higher level of topology is represented by kinematic substructures.
			These kinematic substructures are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				a kinematic tree structure, whose graph representation is a single oriented tree and which consists
