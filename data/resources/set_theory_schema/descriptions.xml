EXAMPLE Consider the class that is the temperature subspace 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. A temperature such as 15 degrees Celsius is a member of the subspace.

The temperature 15 degrees Celsius is the class that consists of all objects with this thermodynamic energy.

The class that consists of all objects with a thermodynamic energy in the range 15 to 20 degrees Celsius is the union_of_all_members of the temperature subspace 10 to 20 degrees Celsius.

NOTE The entity union_of_all_members is equivalent to union, and is used where the operand set has a large or infinite number of members.
