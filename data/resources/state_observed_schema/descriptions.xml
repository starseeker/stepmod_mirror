An <b>ascribable_state</b> is a representation of a relationship that relates one instance of the entity <express_ref linkend="state_observed_schema:ir_express:state_observed_schema.state_observed"/> 
to its <express_ref linkend="state_type_schema:ir_express:state_type_schema.state_type"/> and provides an identification and description of their relationship.</p>
<note number="1">The role of <b>ascribable_state</b> can be defined in the annoted EXPRESS schemas that use or 
specialize this entity, or by default, in an agreement of common understanding between the partners sharing this information.

<note number="2">The characteristics that describe an observed state may be recorded by reference to relevant 
<express_ref linkend="state_type_schema:ir_express:state_type_schema.state_type"/> entities using the <b>ascribable_state</b> entity.  Relationships between two <b>ascribable_state</b> entities 
is represented by the <express_ref linkend="state_observed_schema:ir_express:state_observed_schema.ascribable_state_relationship"/> entity (see 5.3.2).

<example number="1">
A laboratory has analyzed a marine distillate fuel and assessed its water content to be "0.5%" by volume.  
With a water specification maximum limit of "0.3%" the marine distillate fuel is ascribed as "exceeding" the limit.

A <b>state_observed</b> is the existence of a mode of being for a period of time.

Objects in the same state in one context may be different states in a different context.  
An object may be a primitive or a system.  The same object may be a primitive in one process
