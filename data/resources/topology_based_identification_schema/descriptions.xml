	The object space is the local 3D Cartesian coordinate space of the form feature.</p>
	<p>For the calculation of SEIs, it is required to determine reference points of the topological entities having the same identifications in the following manner. 
	Reference points of two topological entities that may cause ambiguity must be different [4]. 
	Suppose A and B are split faces as illustrated in Figure <a href="#figure_fig18">18</a>. Firstly, axis-aligned bounding boxes for A, B are generated. 
	Then, all the boundary lines of the smaller bounding box are extended. If there is no intersection between extended lines and the other face, any points in A and B can be selected as illustrated in Figure <a href="#figure_fig18">18</a> (a). 
	If there is an intersection between the extended lines of A and face B, one of the intersecting points should be selected as illustrated in Figure <a href="#figure_fig18">18</a> (b). 
	If there are intersections in many directions, extended lines parallel to x axis have the first priority, and extended lines parallel to y axis have the second priority, and extended lines parallel to z axis have the last priority. 
	If there are multiple intersections in one direction, all the intersecting points will be compared by their coordinates. 
	For the comparison of coordinates, x precedes y and y precedes z, and a point with the smallest value will be selected.

	A <b>user_selected_topology_element</b> is a type of <express_ref linkend="geometry_schema:ir_express:geometry_schema.geometric_representation_item"/> in ISO 10303-42 represents an element selected via its persistent identification in the procedural shape modelling.
	<note number="1">
		A <b>user_selected_topology_element</b> instance can be an element in a set of <express_ref linkend="representation_schema:ir_express:representation_schema.representation_item"/> instances defined in the attribute <express_ref linkend="procedural_model_schema:ir_express:procedural_model_schema.user_selected_elements.picked_items"/> of the entity <express_ref linkend="procedural_model_schema:ir_express:procedural_model_schema.user_selected_elements"/> in ISO 10303-55 [2].

	<note number="2">
		This entity <b>user_selected_topology_element</b> is to select an element which is topologically identified by this part of ISO 10303, 
		whereas <express_ref linkend="procedural_model_schema:ir_express:procedural_model_schema.user_selected_elements"/> selects an element geometrically from the user’s view point. 
		If a model is procedurally created by construction operations from scratch and all the elements comprising the model can be therefore topologically identified, 
		<express_ref linkend="procedural_model_schema:ir_express:procedural_model_schema.user_selected_elements"/> can be substituted for <b>user_selected_topology_element</b> for selecting an element. 
		In other words, both entities can be interchangeably used.

	The boolean function <b>face_in_brep</b> accepts as input a <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face"/> and a <express_ref linkend="geometric_model_schema:ir_express:geometric_model_schema.manifold_solid_brep"/> and returns true if the face is one of the faces used to define the shells of the B-rep. 
	The function first uses the <express_ref linkend="geometric_model_schema:ir_express:geometric_model_schema.msb_shells"/> function to construct the set of all the shells of the B-rep. 
	For each shell of this set it uses the <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.list_shell_faces"/> function to construct a list of faces, each face in the list is compared to the input <b>test_face</b> and, if identical the function returns TRUE. 
	If no match is found after all faces of all shells have been tested the function returns FALSE.
