	<p>For the calculation of SEIs, it is required to determine reference points of the topological entities having the same identifications.

	<note>
		A possible algorithm for determining reference points is described below [4]. Suppose A and B are split faces as illustrated in Figure <a href="#figure_fig18">18</a>. Firstly, axis-aligned bounding boxes for A, B are generated. 
		Then, all the boundary lines of the smaller bounding box are extended. If there is no intersection between extended lines and the other face, any points in A and B can be selected as illustrated in Figure <a href="#figure_fig18">18</a> (a). 
		If there is an intersection between the extended lines of A and face B, one of the intersecting points should be selected as illustrated in Figure <a href="#figure_fig18">18</a> (b). 
		If there are intersections in many directions, extended lines parallel to x axis have the first priority, and extended lines parallel to y axis have the second priority, and extended lines parallel to z axis have the last priority. 
		If there are multiple intersections in one direction, all the intersecting points will be compared by their coordinates. 
		For the comparison of coordinates, x precedes y and y precedes z, and a point with the smallest value will be selected.

		Figure <a href="#figure_fig19">19</a> shows an example of split elements. Using the algorithm described above, <b>split_elements_number</b> becomes 2, and the <b>element_order</b> of face 2 and face 3 become 1 and 2 respectively.

	The boolean function <b>face_in_brep</b> accepts as input a <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face"/> and a <express_ref linkend="geometric_model_schema:ir_express:geometric_model_schema.manifold_solid_brep"/> and returns TRUE if the face is one of the faces used to define the shells of the B-rep. 
	The function first uses the <express_ref linkend="geometric_model_schema:ir_express:geometric_model_schema.msb_shells"/> function to construct the set of all the shells of the B-rep. 
	For each <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.closed_shell"/> of this set it uses the <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.list_shell_faces"/> function to construct a list of faces, each face in the list is compared to the input <b>test_face</b> and, if identical the function returns TRUE. 
	If no match is found after all faces of all shells have been tested the function returns FALSE.
	<note>
		The functions <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.list_shell_faces"/> and <express_ref linkend="geometric_model_schema:ir_express:geometric_model_schema.msb_shells"/> are defined in ISO 10303-42.
