  is a finite, non-self-intersecting open curve in R<sup><i>m</i></sup>, that is,
    a connected 1-dimensional manifold. The bounds of an <b>edge</b> are two
    vertices, which need not be distinct.
    The edge is oriented by choosing its traversal direction
    to run from the first to the second vertex. If the two vertices are the
   same,
    the edge is a  self-loop. The domain of the edge does not include
 its  bounds, and 0 &lt;  &#926; &lt; &#8734;. </p>
 <p>       Associated with an edge may be a geometric <express_ref linkend="geometry_schema:ir_express:geometry_schema.curve"/> to locate
    the edge in a coordinate space; this is represented by the
  <b>edge_curve</b> subtype. The curve shall be finite and non-self-intersecting
    within the domain of the edge. 
    An <b>edge</b> is a graph, so its multiplicity M and graph genus G<sup><i>e</i></sup>
  may be  determined by the graph traversal algorithm. Since M = <b><i>E</i></b> = 1, the
  Euler equation reduces in this case to </p>

<!-- +++++++++++ face +++++++++++ -->
<ext_description linkend="topology_schema.face">
<p>	A <b>face</b> is a type of
	<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.topological_representation_item"/>,   of dimensionality 2 corresponding
 to   the intuitive notion of a piece of surface bounded by loops. Its domain, if
   present, is an oriented, connected, finite 2-manifold in R<sup><i>m</i></sup>. A face
  domain   shall not have handles, but it may have holes, each hole bounded by a loop.
   The domain of the underlying geometry of the face, if present,
   does not contain its bounds, and  0 &lt;  &#926; &lt; &#8734;.
  A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are
    defined as <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_bound"/>s. A face shall have at least
    one bound, and the bounds shall be distinct and shall not
    intersect. One <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.loop"/> is optionally distinguished, using the
    <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_outer_bound"/> subtype, as the
    &quot;outer&quot; loop of the face.  If so, it establishes a preferred
    way of embedding the face domain in the plane, in which the
    other bounding loops of the face are &quot;inside&quot; the outer
    loop.  Because the face domain is arcwise connected, no inner
    loop shall contain any other loop.  This is true
    regardless of which embedding in the plane is chosen. </p>

 <p>   A geometric <express_ref linkend="geometry_schema:ir_express:geometry_schema.surface"/> may be associated with the face. This may
    be done explicitly through the <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface"/> subtype, or
    implicitly if the faces are defined by <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.poly_loop"/>s. 
    In the latter  case, the surface is the plane containing the points of
    the <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.poly_loop"/>s. In either case, a topological normal
    <b>n</b> is associated with the face, such that the cross
    product <b>n</b>  &#215; <b>t</b>  points toward the interior of
    the face, where <b>t</b> is the tangent to a bounding loop.
    That is, each loop runs counter-clockwise around the face when
    viewed from above, if we consider the normal <b>n</b> to point
    up. Each loop is associated through a <b>face_bound</b> entity
    with a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop direction is
    oriented correctly with respect to the face normal (TRUE) or
    should be reversed (FALSE).
      For a face of the subtype <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface"/>, the topological
    normal <b>n</b> is defined from the normal of the underlying
    surface, together with the BOOLEAN attribute <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface.same_sense"/>, and
    this in turn, determines on which side of the loop the face
    interior lies, using the cross-product rule described above. </p>

  <p>  When a <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.vertex_loop"/> is used as a
    <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_bound"/> the sense of the topological normal is derived from
    any other bounding loops, or, in the case of a <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface"/>, from
    the <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface.face_geometry"/> and the <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface.same_sense"/> flag. If the <b>face</b>
    has only one bound and this is of type <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.vertex_loop"/>, then the interior
    of the <b>face</b> is the domain of the <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_surface.face_geometry"/>. In
    such a case the underlying surface shall be closed (such as a spherical surface.) </p>


  <p>  The situation is different for a face on an implicit planar
    surface, such as one defined by <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.poly_loop"/>s, which has no
    unique surface normal.  Since the face
    and its bounding loops lie in a plane, the outer loop can
    always be found without ambiguity. Since the face is required
    to be finite, the face interior must lie inside the outer loop,
    and outside each of the remaining loops. These conditions,
    together with the specified loop orientations, define the
    topological normal <b>n</b> using the cross-product rule
    described above. All <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.poly_loop"/> orientations for a given
    face shall produce the same value for <b>n</b>. </p>

  <p>  The edges and vertices referenced by the loops of a face form a
    graph, of which the individual loops are the connected
    components. The Euler equation for this graph becomes: </p>
  <eqn id="eqn5">
      (<b><i>V</i></b> - <b><i>E</i></b>) - (<b><i>L</i></b> - &#931;<sup>L</sup><sub><i>i=1</i></sub> (G<i><sub>i</sub><sup>l</sup></i>)) = 0 &#8195; (5) &#8195; &#8195; &#8195; </eqn>

<!-- +++++++++++ open_shell +++++++++++ -->
<ext_description linkend="topology_schema.open_shell">
<p>	An <b>open_shell</b> is a type of
	<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.connected_face_set"/>,   which is a 
	<express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.shell"/> of dimensionality 2. Its
    domain, if present, is a finite, connected, oriented, 2-manifold
    with boundary, but is not a closed surface. It can be thought of as a 
    <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.closed_shell"/> with 
    one or more holes punched in it. The domain of an open shell
    satisfies 0 &lt; &#926;  &lt;  &#8734;.  An open shell is
    functionally more general than a <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face"/> because its domain can have 
    handles.

    The shell is defined by a collection of <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face"/>s, which may be
    <b>oriented_face</b>s. The sense of each face, after taking account of 
    the orientation, shall agree with the shell normal as defined below.  
    The <b>orientation</b>  can be supplied directly as a BOOLEAN
    attribute of an <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.oriented_face"/>, or be defaulted to TRUE if the
    shell member is a <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face"/> without the orientation
    attribute. </p>

    <p>The following combinatorial restrictions on open shells and geometrical
    restrictions on their domains are designed, together with the informal
    propositions,  to ensure that any domain
    associated with an open shell is an orientable manifold. </p>
    <ul>
     <li> Each face reference shall be unique. </li>
     <li> An <b>open_shell</b> shall have at least one <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face"/>. </li>
     <li> A given <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face"/> may exist in more than one <b>open_shell</b>. </li>
    </ul>
 <p> The boundary of an open shell consists of the edges that are
    referenced only once by the <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.face_bound"/>s (loops) of its faces, together with all of their  vertices. The domain of an open shell, if present,  contains
     all edges and vertices of its faces. </p>
   
   <note>  Note that this is slightly different from the definition of a face
    domain, which includes none of its bounds. For example, a face domain 
    may exclude an isolated point or line segment. An open shell domain may 
    not. (See the algorithm for computing <i><b>B</b></i> below.) </note>

  <p>  The surface genus and topological normal of an open shell are
    those that would be obtained by filling in the holes in its domain to
    produce a closed shell. The topological normal can also be derived from 
    the face normals after taking account of their orientation. The following
    Euler equation is satisfied by open shells.  It is the most general form 
    of Euler equation for connected, orientable surfaces. </p>
    <eqn id="eqn7">
        (<b><i>V</i></b> - <b><i>E</i></b> - <i><b>L</b><sub>l</sub></i> + 2<i><b>F</b></i>) - (2 - 2H - <i><b>B</b></i>) = 0

   <p> where <b><i>V</i></b>, <b><i>E</i></b>, <i><b>L</b><sub>l</sub></i>, <i><b>F</b></i> are, respectively, the
    numbers of distinct vertices, edges,  face bounds, and faces, H is the surface
    genus, and <i><b>B</b></i> is the number of holes. <i><b>B</b></i> can be 
    determined directly from the graph of edges and vertices defining the 
    bounds of the face, in the following manner:</p>
    <p>     Delete all edges from the graph that are referenced twice by the
       face bounds of the face. </p>
     <p> Delete all vertices that have no associated edges. </p>
     <p> Compute <i><b> B</b></i> = the genus of the resulting graph.</p>

   <p> If known a priori, the surface genus H may be used to check
    equation <a href="#eqn7">(7)</a> as an exact equality. Typically, this will not 
    be the case, so equation <a href="#eqn7">(7)</a> or some equivalent formulation 
    shall be used to compute the genus. Since H shall be a non-negative

    The domain of a closed shell, if present, is a connected, closed,
    oriented 2-manifold. It is always topologically equivalent to an 
    H-fold torus for some H &#8805; 0. The number H is referred to as the 
    {<it>surface genus</it> of
    the shell. If a shell of genus H has a domain with coordinate space
    R<sup>3</sup>, the finite region of space inside it is topologically
    equivalent to a solid ball with H tunnels drilled through it. </p>

  <p>  The surface Euler equation <a href="#eqn7">(7)</a> applies with <i><b>B</b></i> = 0,
    because in this case there are no holes. As in the case of 
    <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.open_shell"/>s, the surface genus H may not be known a priori, 
    but shall be an integer &#8805; 0. </p>
  <p>  Thus a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a well-formed closed
    shell is the following: </p>
   <eqn id="eqn9">
     <b><i>V</i></b> - <b><i>E</i></b> - <i><b>L</b><sub>l</sub></i>  shall be even and &#8804;  2 - 2<b><i>F</i></b>
   &#8195; (9) &#8195;</eqn>
    
    <p>   Specifically, the following topological constraints shall be met: </p>
    <ul>
    <li> Each face in the shell is unique.
      <i>  (S<sup>c</sup>){F} = (S<sup>c</sup>)[F]    </i>       </li>
    <li> Each  face bound in the shell is unique.
      <i>  ((S<sup>c</sup>)[F]){ L<sub>l</sub>} = ((S<sup>c</sup>)[F])[ L<sub>l</sub>] </i>  </li>
    <li><p> Each  <express_ref linkend="topology_schema:ir_express:topology_schema.oriented_edge"/> in the shell is unique. </p>
    <eqn> <i> ((S<sup>c</sup>)[F])[ L<sub>l</sub>]){E<sub>l</sub>} = ((S<sup>c</sup>)[F])[L<sub>l</sub>])[E<sub>l</sub>]  </i> </eqn> </li>
  <li><p> Each edge in the shell is either used by exactly two face bounds or is
      used twice by one face bound.</p>
     <eqn><i>  |(((S<sup>c</sup>)[F])[L<sub>l</sub>])\{E<sub>l</sub>}| = 2|(((S<sup>c</sup>)[F])[L<sub>l</sub>]){E}|  </i> </eqn>
