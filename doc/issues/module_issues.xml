    Proposed new wording for Annex A - Short names
  </p>
  <p>
    Where there are NO short names the annex A will read:
  </p>
  <p>
    Entity names in this part of ISO 10303 have been defined in other parts
    of ISO 10303 ISO standards identified in clause 2. Requirements on the use
    of the short names are found in the implementation methods included in ISO
    10303.  
  </p>
  <p>
    If there are short names, 
  </p>
  <p>
    Table A.1 provides the short names for entities defined in the MIM of
    this part of ISO 10303.  

    Entity names in this part of ISO 10303 have been defined in clause 5.2 and
    in other parts of ISO 10303 ISO standards identified in clause 2. 

    Requirements on the use of the short names are found in the
    implementation methods included in ISO 10303.

There is a bug in express2xml.
The XML for intype seems incorrect. E.g.
FUNCTION bag_to_set 
  (the_bag : BAG OF GENERIC : intype) : SET OF GENERIC : intype;
  LOCAL
    the_set: SET OF GENERIC : intype := [];
  END_LOCAL;
  IF SIZEOF (the_bag) > 0 THEN
    REPEAT i := 1 to HIINDEX (the_bag);
      the_set := the_set + the_bag [i];
    END_REPEAT;
  END_IF;
  RETURN (the_set);
END_FUNCTION; -- bag_to_set

express2xml currently generates:

    &lt;function name="bag_to_set">
      &lt;parameter name="the_bag">
        &lt;aggregate type="BAG"/>
        &lt;builtintype type="GENERIC"/>
      &lt;/parameter>
      &lt;aggregate type="SET"/>
      &lt;builtintype type="GENERIC"/>
      &lt;algorithm>
  LOCAL
    the_set: SET OF GENERIC : intype := [];
  END_LOCAL;
  IF SIZEOF (the_bag) &gt; 0 THEN
    REPEAT i := 1 to HIINDEX (the_bag);
      the_set := the_set + the_bag [i];
    END_REPEAT;
  END_IF;
  RETURN (the_set);
      &lt;/algorithm>
    &lt;/function>

The :intype is ignored (I'm not sure what it is for either)

The &lt;rule&gt; element in a mapping specification, can either be a
rule OR a subtype constraint. This is confusing. Furthermore, the
description of the rules field at the top of section 5.1 does not mention
subtype constraints at all.

We should have a rule and subtype element in mapping specification, or
describe the fact that the a rule may be a rule or sub type constraint.

The Supplimentary Directives: ISO TC184/SC4 N1217:2001(E)
state:
4.1.3 Table of contents
a list of clauses, higher level subclauses, annexes, the bibliography (if
present), and the index; As the Foreword and Introduction are not clauses
they are not included in the Contents page. 
I believe that the same is true of ALL SC4 parts. Links are included in the
Contents banner to enable the user to navigate to them.

   In view of the need to maintain configuration control across a 
  modular structure, SC4 will always need to refer to specific dated 
  issues of modules.

<description>
   Tthere are other ways to accomplish the same thing.  By having 
   dated normative references to modules, we will force ISO to retain 
   all versions of all modules in the ISO catalog for the forseeable 
   future.  That could be a big administrative burden.  We are 
   basically using ISO's publication system with its numbering scheme 
   for a purpose it was never intended -- as a de facto PDM system for 
   SC4.

   Although the current approach may be necessary in the short term, I 
   believe that SC4 should consider alternative approaches that would 
   allow undated normative references for the longer term.

And have seen the following in 4.2.5 in the supplementary directives:

- If clause 3 only contains terms and definitions, the title of the clause shall be "Terms and definitions".
- If clause 3 only contains terms, definitions, and abbreviations, the title of the clause shall be
"Terms, definitions, and abbreviations".
- If clause 3 only contains terms, definitions, and symbols, the title of the clause shall be "Terms,
definitions, and symbols".
- If clause 3 contains terms, definitions, abbreviations, and symbols, the title of the clause shall be
"Terms, definitions, abbreviations, and symbols".

A number of the modules just contain Terms and Abbreviations.
Hence, the XSL outputs Terms and Abbreviations - I can change it to output
Terms, definitions, and abbreviations
But there are no definitions.

So, in this case, what should the title be

5. All of the headings seem to be H2 style. Is it possible to use different heading styles for different levels of headings (e.g. 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.)?
</description>

<comment

<description>
  I believe this proposal is an editorial opinion, which is counter 
  to the content of the Directives, and their example, where all 
  headings appear in the same font.
</description>
</comment>

<comment
   by="Gerry Radack"
   date="04-04-07">
<description>
   The HTML Guidelines say: "All clause and subclause headings, 
   regardless of level, shall be enclosed within H2 elements, except 
   that the clauses defining terms shall be enclosed within H4 
   elements."  AP 239 does seem to be following this.

   This was done to maintain compatibility with existing traditional 
   APs, which use the same font size for various heading levels.

   Note that the ISO STD Template uses 12 point for level 1 headings, 
   11 point for level 2 headings, and 10 point for level 3 and higher 
   headings, but the Supplementary Directives mandates 14 point for 
   level 1, 12 point for level 2 and 11 point for level 3 and higher.

   We were hampered by the fact that we were told that ISO did not 
   allow the use of cascading style sheets.  With cascading style 
   sheets, it would be possible use different heading tags for 
   different heading levels, while still having them display in the 
   same font size (if that is desired).

<description>
  The figures being referred to are EXPRESS-G figures which are a 
  sequence of EXPRESS-G diagrams that can span more than one page, 
  hence there is the convention to say "1 of n" where n is the total 
  number of pages in the diagram. In the examples looked at there was 
  only 1 page to the diagrams, hence "1 of 1". There are many other 
  examples where there is more than 1 page to an EXPRESS-G diagram.

   The HTML Guidelines do not have any specific guidance on the 
   formatting of the Bibliography.

   Please be more specific about what is the problem.  I thought that 
   SD section 4.3.2.1 was based on ISO 690.  The "layout" seems to be 
   the same as in the SD, except that there is a "hanging indent" 
   (second and following lines of each bibliography entry are 
   indented) shown in the example in the SD that is not present in the 
   documents provided.  Is this what Mr. Cook is referring to?  Or has 
   ISO 690 been updated and the update not reflected in the SD?

   It would be helpful if a copy of ISO 690 could be placed in the SC4 
   Standards Developers Information/ISO Standards folder on SC4ONLINE 
   for use by people preparing SC4 parts.

9. There is a file called "f_guide.htm" with each of the documents. It
appears to be a template for another annex, but has not been completed in
any of the documents we evaluated. Is it necessary to leave it, or should
it be removed if it is not being used? (Or should it be kept to possibly be
used at a later date?)

<description>
  The way the XML/XSL works is that there is one html file for each 
  possible clause / annex. If the annex has not been used in the 
  document, as is the case here, then the HTML exists, but is not 
  accessible from the table of contents. It would be easier if we 
  could leave the file there. We could add some text that said "An 
  Application module implementation and usage guide has not been 
  provided" so if a user did open the file directly they know that 
  the annex was not provided.
