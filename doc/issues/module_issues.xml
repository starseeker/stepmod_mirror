    Proposed new wording for Annex A - Short names

  <p>
    Where there are NO short names the annex A will read:
  </p>
  <p>
    Entity names in this part of ISO 10303 have been defined in other parts
    of ISO 10303 ISO standards identified in clause 2. Requirements on the use
    of the short names are found in the implementation methods included in ISO
    10303.  
  </p>
  <p>
    If there are short names, 
  </p>
  <p>
    Table A.1 provides the short names for entities defined in the MIM of
    this part of ISO 10303.  

    Entity names in this part of ISO 10303 have been defined in clause 5.2 and
    in other parts of ISO 10303 ISO standards identified in clause 2. 

    Requirements on the use of the short names are found in the

There is a bug in express2xml.
The XML for intype seems incorrect. E.g.
FUNCTION bag_to_set 
  (the_bag : BAG OF GENERIC : intype) : SET OF GENERIC : intype;
  LOCAL
    the_set: SET OF GENERIC : intype := [];
  END_LOCAL;
  IF SIZEOF (the_bag) > 0 THEN
    REPEAT i := 1 to HIINDEX (the_bag);
      the_set := the_set + the_bag [i];
    END_REPEAT;
  END_IF;
  RETURN (the_set);
END_FUNCTION; -- bag_to_set

express2xml currently generates:

    &lt;function name="bag_to_set">
      &lt;parameter name="the_bag">
        &lt;aggregate type="BAG"/>
        &lt;builtintype type="GENERIC"/>
      &lt;/parameter>
      &lt;aggregate type="SET"/>
      &lt;builtintype type="GENERIC"/>
      &lt;algorithm>
  LOCAL
    the_set: SET OF GENERIC : intype := [];
  END_LOCAL;
  IF SIZEOF (the_bag) &gt; 0 THEN
    REPEAT i := 1 to HIINDEX (the_bag);
      the_set := the_set + the_bag [i];
    END_REPEAT;
  END_IF;
  RETURN (the_set);
      &lt;/algorithm>
    &lt;/function>

The :intype is ignored (I'm not sure what it is for either)

The &lt;rule&gt; element in a mapping specification, can either be a
rule OR a subtype constraint. This is confusing. Furthermore, the
description of the rules field at the top of section 5.1 does not mention
subtype constraints at all.

We should have a rule and subtype element in mapping specification, or
describe the fact that the a rule may be a rule or sub type constraint.

The Supplimentary Directives: ISO TC184/SC4 N1217:2001(E)
state:
4.1.3 Table of contents
a list of clauses, higher level subclauses, annexes, the bibliography (if

   There are other ways to accomplish the same thing.  By having 
   dated normative references to modules, we will force ISO to retain 
   all versions of all modules in the ISO catalog for the forseeable 
   future.  That could be a big administrative burden.  We are 
   basically using ISO's publication system with its numbering scheme 
   for a purpose it was never intended -- as a de facto PDM system for 
   SC4.

   Although the current approach may be necessary in the short term, I 
   believe that SC4 should consider alternative approaches that would 
   allow undated normative references for the longer term.

A number of the modules just contain Terms and Abbreviations.

    SC4 Response: Our Supplementary Directives include the following
guidance (4.2.5)
- If clause 3 only contains terms and definitions, the title of the clause shall be "Terms and definitions". 
- If clause 3 only contains terms, definitions, and abbreviations, the title of the clause shall be "Terms, definitions, and abbreviations".

- If clause 3 contains terms, definitions, abbreviations, and symbols, the title of the clause shall be "Terms, definitions, abbreviations, and symbols". 

A number of the modules just contain terms and abbreviations. Hence, the

want the title of the clause to contain "definitions" even if there are no
definitions.   If this is so, then we will change the script accordingly.

    Yes, please make the requested change because, even though there are no

5. All of the headings seem to be H2 style. Is it possible to use different heading styles for different levels of headings (e.g. 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.)?
</description>

<comment

   date="04-04-07">
<description>
  I believe this proposal is an editorial opinion, which is counter 
  to the content of the Directives, and their example, where all 
  headings appear in the same font.
</description>
</comment>

<comment
   by="Gerry Radack"
   date="04-04-07">
<description>
   The HTML Guidelines say: "All clause and subclause headings, 
   regardless of level, shall be enclosed within H2 elements, except 
   that the clauses defining terms shall be enclosed within H4 
   elements."  AP 239 does seem to be following this.

   This was done to maintain compatibility with existing traditional 
   APs, which use the same font size for various heading levels.

   Note that the ISO STD Template uses 12 point for level 1 headings, 
   11 point for level 2 headings, and 10 point for level 3 and higher 
   headings, but the Supplementary Directives mandates 14 point for 
   level 1, 12 point for level 2 and 11 point for level 3 and higher.

   We were hampered by the fact that we were told that ISO did not 
   allow the use of cascading style sheets.  With cascading style 
   sheets, it would be possible use different heading tags for 
   different heading levels, while still having them display in the 
   same font size (if that is desired).

    SC4 Response:  All our current standards (and the ISO Directives) use
    the same font size for different levels of headings, and this has been
    carried forward into the HTML guidelines.  To replicate this with different
    heading tags would require the use of cascading style sheets, which ISO
    told us were not permitted.  Also, to rework all the headings to use
    different tags and/or use cascading style sheets would require a
    substantial amount of effort.
    Please confirm whether it is considered essential to deviate from
    previously accepted practice.  
  </p>
  <p>
    ISO response:
    No, you may leave the heading styles as they
    are. No action required.

6. The figure captions all seem to have the words "1 of 1" at the end. Is there a reason for this?
</description>

<comment

   date="04-04-07">
<description>
  The figures being referred to are EXPRESS-G figures which are a 
  sequence of EXPRESS-G diagrams that can span more than one page, 
  hence there is the convention to say "1 of n" where n is the total 
  number of pages in the diagram. In the examples looked at there was 
  only 1 page to the diagrams, hence "1 of 1". There are many other 
  examples where there is more than 1 page to an EXPRESS-G diagram.

7. The Bibliography layout is incorrect. Please see ISO 690 for the correct layout.

   The HTML Guidelines do not have any specific guidance on the 
   formatting of the Bibliography.

   Please be more specific about what is the problem.  I thought that 
   SD section 4.3.2.1 was based on ISO 690.  The "layout" seems to be 
   the same as in the SD, except that there is a "hanging indent" 
   (second and following lines of each bibliography entry are 
   indented) shown in the example in the SD that is not present in the 
   documents provided.  Is this what Mr. Cook is referring to?  Or has 
   ISO 690 been updated and the update not reflected in the SD?

   It would be helpful if a copy of ISO 690 could be placed in the SC4 
   Standards Developers Information/ISO Standards folder on SC4ONLINE 
   for use by people preparing SC4 parts.

8. The links between documents and many links within documents are broken.

  The links work across multiple documents extracted into the same 
  file strucutre, which is how they are intended to be used.  This 
  has been agreed with the ISO TPM, since the principal publication 
  will be integrated on a CD-ROM.

SC4 response:
Can you provide some examples of the internal links that you consider to be
broken, assuming that the files have been unzipped inclusive of the
directory structure?   
  </p>
  <p>
    ISO response:
    One example is in the first paragraph of 4.3.1 of ISO/TS
    10303-1004. SC4 needs to check this.
  </p>
  <p>
    The link does not work as it is a link to a separate module.

9. There is a file called "f_guide.htm" with each of the documents. It
appears to be a template for another annex, but has not been completed in
any of the documents we evaluated. Is it necessary to leave it, or should
it be removed if it is not being used? (Or should it be kept to possibly be
used at a later date?)

  The way the XML/XSL works is that there is one html file for each 
  possible clause / annex. If the annex has not been used in the 
  document, as is the case here, then the HTML exists, but is not 
  accessible from the table of contents. It would be easier if we 
  could leave the file there. We could add some text that said "An 
  Application module implementation and usage guide has not been 
  provided" so if a user did open the file directly they know that 
  the annex was not provided.

It is trivial to add the text: "An Application module implementation and
usage guide has not been provided" so I have. Modifiying the readme will
more work. There is an assumption that people will open each file
individually. I had always assumed that as it was an HTML document, users
would navigate their way around the document using the HTML links provided
in the document and never look at the individual HTML files

Are we expecting ISO to edit these cover pages?
If so, what happens when we publish an AP? The AP will include its modules, which will have been previously published, and may have been included in other APs.
Are ISO going to go through all the modules that go with the AP and correct the ISO coverpage?
It would be better if we could provide them with a front page generated from the modules XMLs.
  </p>
  <p>
The issues are:
  </p>
  <p> 
The French title
Everything is French, except for the name of the module.
   </p>
  <p>
The edition statement:
???? edition  ####-##-##
I assume that the ???? equals First second etc. 
What Does ####-##-## mean?
Is that the date of publication?
I presume that this is set by ISO. 
If so, then we have an issue when we package modules
Or, is it the date we decide to send it to ISO?
Right now we only record the year of publication in the module.
I have output
First  edition  2004
   </p>
  <p>
They include
Price base on ## pages
What does this mean?
Am I supposed to write some software that counts how many HTML pages there are in each module?
Not something that I really have time to do ...
   </p>
  <p>
They include:
ICS  ##.###.##;  ##.###.##
What is supposed to go here?
I have included
ICS  25.040.40
As that is what was discussed before

The cover page requires the publication date. This is provided by ISO. For
the current batch of modules, it should be: 2004-12-01
  This will require a change to the modules/resources/AP + DTDs.
Who provides the publication date? 
How does that get added to the module?
We need to add a publication.date attribute to every module/resource/AP + DTDs
For current modules ISO say use: 2004-12-01

Re. point 5 and double colon: If that's the way that you've done it in the past then I can't really argue but its not usual English usage and frankly is odd. I would have thought something like 
Industrial automation systems and integration  
Product data representation and exchange 
Part 1250: 
Application module "Attachment slot"
 
or 
 
"Attachment slot" application module 
or 
 
Industrial automation systems and integration  
Product data representation and exchange application modules 
Part 1250: 
Attachment slot
was more usual English. Maybe bear it in mind for the next generation?

See the attached DIS for an example. This is of course not in HTML but is sufficient to give you the general idea. Off hand I don't recall a case of an HTML DIS which is a revision but if you are desperate I can always dig so let me know.

ISO have mandated that modules are published as individual
parts. Consequently, all images displayed in a module must be stored in the
modules directory.
  &lt;img src="../schematic_element/definition_and_occurrence.gif"/&gt;
is illegal for example.
There should be a test that warns people that when this occurs

This is because the Title in the scope is tagged in HTML as &lt;h1> as per the

1. As we mentioned previously, the link in the Foreword -
http://www.tc184-sc4.org/titles/STEP_Titles.htm - is different from the
link that was agreed with SC4 last year for 10303 parts -
http://www.tc184-sc4.org/titles/. Will the former be valid for the

Because of limitations of the tools, in order for the diagram links to work properly, whenever an interfaced entity is referenced , it is necessary to explicitly USE FROM the schema where the interfaced entity is originally defined, regardless of any indirect interfacing that may exist.

Certain missing assertions are not caught by module error checking. These appear to be cases such as - select = select = entity, and perhaps cases of redeclared attributes that are selecgts.  The AP mapping index catches these. It would be nice to catch them sooner.

We have made an assumption in the EXPRESS definitions in stepmod that that
if you use a word with an _ in it then you are describing an EXPRESS
entity, in which case it should be in bold or hyperlinked. 
We have implemented a test to enforce this. 

However, it is not always the case that a word with an _ is an EXPRESS
entity. It may be a string used in an attribute. 

(Though someone once told me that there was an unwritten rule in SC4 that
attribute strings should not contain _ . Maybe that just applied to strings
added in mapping tables)  

Anyway, an example is the application_protocol_definition_required rule that
I believe that we are required to add to the AP MIM.

The normative references should be ordered ISO then IEC. I do not think
that this affects any modules.

Update the meta data in the HTML to hold ALL the information that is in the SC4 cover page. I.e. add:
DC.Replaces =  the supercedes info.
DC.Issued = publication date
SC4.version = version

For check lists:
SC4.checklist.internal_review = SC4 internal_review checklist
SC4.checklist.project_leader = SC4 project_leader checklist
SC4.checklist.convener = SC4 convener checklist

The URL in the foreword
http://www.tc184-sc4.org/titles/STEP_Titles.htm.

is not that same format specified in the SD:
&lt;http://www.tc184-sc4.org/titles/STEP_Titles.htm&gt;

The foreword was provided by ISO so we should change the approach used in
the modules to conform with ISO.

The references to URLS should now say:
 "is available from the following URL: "
Need to change the foreword.
This was agreed between John McKillop ISO and  Howard Mason SC4
