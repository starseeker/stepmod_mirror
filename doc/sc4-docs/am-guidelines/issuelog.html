<p>Issue : Section 5 has the statement This subclause provides a complete list
of the UoFs defined in the AM and defined in any other AM used directly or

<p>Clause : 5 Specification of application module content</p>
<p>Category : Major Technical</p>
<p>Issue Date : 9 Nov 2000</p>
<p>Issue : Secetion 5.2.1 Information requirements documentation states This
subclause provides a complete list of the UoFs defined in the AM and defined in
any other AM used directly or indirectly by the AM.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that an AM should only reference the UoFs that it addresses
directly.</p>
<p>1. the higher level the module the longer this list of indirect AMs/UoFs will
get.</p>
<p>2. the indirect list can be generated automatically from the USE FROM
statements</p>
<p>3. the HTML modules repository does this already</p>
<p>4. this is another list that needs to be checked and is only informative as
the USE FROM statements are the definitive information</p>
<p>5. Module developers have not consistently followed this rule, some modules
have the full list and some don't</p>
<p>Proposed Solution/Remarks : Remove the requirement for the indirect AMs/UoFs</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Rejected/Deferred. There is a requirement from readers of
the modules, who may not be EXPRESS literate, for an AM to specify the complete
set of capability an implementation of that AM has. This list cannot be
generated from EXPRESS in the case where any AM contains more than one UoF which
is allowed by the guidelines. No better solution to the requirement has been
found, should one be proposed it might very well be adopted. If you find a
better solution please resubmit this comment with the solution during the formal
Standing Document ballot. Once the AMs are in the XML repository, this list can
be generated by software eliminating any human error.</p>

<p>WG10 N317 comments - Howard Mason</p>
<p>Most of these comments are probably editorial.....</p>
<p>Clause 4.1 states that text in brackets should be replaced - do we actually
mean text in&lt;&gt; - otherwise it states that the definition of ISO is open to
redefinition in each AM. If it does mean text in &lt;&gt;, what is the
implication for the URL of the list of parts</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Accepted. Reworded</p>
<hr>
<p>Clause 4.2 - what do you mean by domain ?</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Deferred</p>
<p>The use of the word domain was copied from AP guidelines. I do not have an
OED but in the online Cambridge dictionary &quot;area of interest&quot; seems to
fit best. This is also a word used in the database community to mean &quot;set
of allowed values&quot;. Either works in this case. Perhaps this word should be
defined for STEP use in Part 1?</p>
<hr>
<p>Clause 4.4 - do we really want to list all subsidiary definitions in a
hierarchy of AMs??</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Rejected/Deferred. Please see response to CEV 4 on UoFs
list.</p>

<p>Clause 4.5.2 - consistency suggests that the title should be &quot;The
referenced application module ARMs&quot;</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Accepted.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clause 4.6.1.2 - should this not refer to &quot;in a using AM&quot;, rather
than ARM</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Rejected. The current text is more precise than what is
proposed. One could imagine somehow completing abstract concepts in a mapping
specification syntax so the more precise statement is preferred.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clause 4.7 - is the definition of Annex F sensible? Do we want to formalise
definitions from other</p>
<p>AMs in a document on a temporary basis.</p>

<p>CLASSIFICATION:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The idea developed within the second sentence &quot;As part of the migration
... that ARM in annex F&quot; should be re-studied. The mechanism that consists
in defining an informative ARM based on modules which do not yet exist is rather
dangerous for the future consistency of these modules that are developed by this
means. What kind of &quot;consensus&quot; want you reach ?.Moreover, what does
mean the third sentence &quot;Requirements on an interpretation of that ARM ...
annex F&quot; ?</p>
<p>Questions have to be solved, like:</p>
<p>- What means an &quot;informative ARM&quot; within a standard part ?</p>
<p>- Will this module be re-studied when the module that didn&#146;t exit at the
first stage, will be written.</p>
<p>- What will become the annex F of the first module, when this referenced
module will become actual ?</p>

<p>ISSUE NUMBER 7</p>
<p>AUTHOR: P. Huau, pascalhuau@compuserve.com</p>
<p>CLAUSE : All</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>As their content is described, Appl. modules seem to be documents that will
evolve along time. For example, in clause 4.5.2, it is suggested that the
content of annex F will change when new base modules are defined.</p>
<p>This raises the question of the ability to make evolutions in the content of
the modules and to manage the publication of the new versions at the right time.</p>
<p>If we have a hierarchical structure of modules, how will a
modification/correction of a module be propagated?</p>
<p>Will changes in a module effective at once for all the other modules or APs
which use it or will there be effectivity conditions?</p>
<p>Will there be retention periods for the module (see application object
retention_period in AP214)?</p>
<p>PROPOSED SOLUTION</p>
<p>Set up a periodic publication (e.g. one per year), on CDROMs, of the whole
set of modules and of APs that are based on them. This compendium shall be
consistent and coherent (otherwise, no publication).</p>
<p>Recommend/require implementations based on these official and consistent
packages and not on intermediate partial sets of modules.</p>

<p>ISSUE NUMBER 8</p>
<p>AUTHOR: P. Huau, pascalhuau@compuserve.com.CLAUSE : 4.7</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>It is required that all types and entities be documented. This requirement is
too strong, in the light of the common practice in APs. When a concept, entity
or type, need not to be completely detailed, e.g. an attribute has for type a
predefined Express type, this attribute is usually not fully depicted in
Express-G.</p>
<p>PROPOSED SOLUTION</p>
<p>Change the specification to allow predefined Express types not to be
represented</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Accepted.</p>

<p>ISSUE NUMBER 9</p>
<p>AUTHOR: P. Huau, pascalhuau@compuserve.com</p>
<p>CLAUSE : AnnexF</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The content of this annexF shows that there is a confusion, in this guideline
document, between the process of defining technical specifications, which
include writing of evolving working drafts and the characterization of the
required content of a standard or of a technical specification that will be sold
by ISO and related publishers for conforming implementations.</p>
<p>While it is normal during the process of a project to have incomplete
sections or parts and to replace them by the requirements these sections or
parts will cover, it is not possible to publish a final version of a standard or
TS that contain or refer to sections or parts &quot;to be defined&quot;. Any
module, being published, shall be complete and ready for implementation or use
in other documents.</p>
<p>PROPOSED SOLUTION</p>
<p>Remove annex F or specify that annexF shall only be present in working drafts
of the module and not in the published version of the module.</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Accepted. Added text stating this annex should not appear
in completed AMs.</p>

<p>ISSUE NUMBER 10</p>
<p>AUTHOR: P. Huau, pascalhuau@compuserve.com</p>
<p>CLAUSE : 5.2.2</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Except for requiring that the Express ARM constructs be sorted by class of
constructs, in alphabetical order, the purpose of this clause is not clear. It
seems to require in a very complex manner that the Express ARM be fully
documented.</p>
<p>PROPOSED SOLUTION</p>
<p>Only keep the requirement for alphabetical order per class of Express
construct. Require the Express ARM be documented and specify the format of the
documentation. Precise if the ARM need to be completely specified or if basic
types (e.g. INTEGER, STRING) may be replaced by a single artifact one (as it is
done in recent APs)</p>
<p>CLOSED 2001-02-15 Accepted. This text was copied/modified from N535 AP
guidelines directions for EXPRESS-G ARMs 5.3.1.1. Some additions were made as
the result of issues raised in the WG10 project. All but the minimum
requirements have been removed.</p>

<p>ISSUE NUMBER 11</p>
<p>AUTHOR: P. Huau, pascalhuau@compuserve.com</p>
<p>CLAUSE : 5.3.3</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION:</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>We are quite surprised not to see recommendation for the usage of
Extensible_select and Extensible_enumeration, at least in order to dealt with
management information (e.g. approval).</p>
<p>Use of the extensible constructs is a key of the modular approach; without,
modules are just a more complex way.to split formal specification of product
data.</p>
<p>PROPOSED SOLUTION</p>
<p>Recommend and Use the concept of Extensible_select and Extensible_enumeration.</p>
<p>NB: in order to ensure extensibility, probably, the select types should be
&quot;not extensible&quot; only in the application protocols, while staying
extensible in all the modules.</p>

select and enumeration data types. More detail on this should also be added in

<p>ISSUE NUMBER: JPN Guidelines for AM contents #1</p>
<p>AUTHOR: JNC ad hoc group (contact person: Hiroyuki HIRAOKA)</p>
<p>CLAUSE:</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION: Major technical</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>When an AM uses other AMs, ARM of using AM uses ARM of used AMs, mappig
specification of using AM includes mapping specification of used AMs, and MIM of
using AM uses MIM of used AMs. This structure seems redundant and there may be a
risk of inconsistency between these three relations.</p>
<p>PROPOSED SOLUTION:</p>
<p>RESOLUTION:</p>
<p>CLOSED : 2001-02-14 : By always requiring the use of a complete AM, as long
as the AM being used is self-consistent, this issue should be manageable during
the development/ballot of the AMs in question. This concern can be added to the
Recommended Practices for modules developers document which is being developed.</p>

<p>ISSUE NUMBER: JPN Modularization Guidelines #15</p>
<p>AUTHOR: JNC ad hoc group (contact person: Hiroyuki.HIRAOKA)</p>
<p>CLAUSE: all</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION: Major technical</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Many issues are raised at the beginning of Application Module project in WG10
workshops and ISO meetings. Comments are also gathered at the start of STEP
Modularization PWI. It is not clear how these issues and comments are resolved
in these guidelines.</p>
<p>PROPOSED SOLUTION:</p>
<p>Provide the complete issues log.</p>
<p>RESOLUTION:</p>
<p>CLOSED : 2001-02-14</p>
<p>While this may be a valid comment, it doesn't propose any particular change
to one of the Guidelines.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that these three Guidelines are only intended to
specify the content of AP/AM and a high level process. Detailed issues of
&quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; are left to other deliverables like
recommended practices and to the harmonization team and WG3. WG10 and WG12.
Additionally, an update to the project issues log will be done which may help.</p>
