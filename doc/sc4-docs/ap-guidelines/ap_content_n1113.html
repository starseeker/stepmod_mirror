<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable
representation and exchange of product data. The objective is to provide a
neutral mechanism capable of describing product data throughout the life cycle
of a product independent from any particular system. The nature of this
description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a
basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving.
<p>This International Standard is organized as a series of parts, each published
separately. The parts of ISO 10303 fall into one of the following series:
description methods, integrated resources, application interpreted constructs,
application modules<sup>1</sup>, application protocols, abstract test suites,
implementation methods, and conformance testing. The series are described in ISO
10303-1.
<p>Application modules are the key component of the modularization of the
initial STEP architecture. The modularization approach extends the application
interpreted construct (AIC) concept of the initial STEP architecture through
inclusion of the relevant portions of the AP's application reference model. The
basis of the approach is understanding and harmonizing the requirements, both
new and those documented in existing APs, grouping the requirements into
reuseable modules, documenting the modules, and using the modules in the
development of an application protocol. With much of the content of the initial
STEP architecture AP now documented in AMs, the role of the AP is to select and
constrain a set of the more generic AMs to satisfy information requirements in a
particular application context.
<p>The development of an application protocol modularization strategy was driven
by several requirements from different sources:
<ul>
  <li>to reduce the high cost of developing an application protocol;</li>
  <li>to ensure the ability to implement a combination of subsets of multiple
    APs or to extend existing APs to meet a business need; ;</li>
  <li>to ensure the ability to reuse application software developed to support
    one AP in the development of an implementation of another AP with the same,
    or similar, requirements; ;</li>
  <li>to avoid the duplication and repeated documentation of the same
    requirements in different application protocols leading to potentially
    different solutions for the same requirements; and ;</li>
  <li>to ensure the ability to reuse data generated by an implementation of one
    or more APs by an implementation of one or more different APs. ;</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this standing document is to provide guidelines for the
content of ISO 10303 application protocols (APs) that use application modules
(AMs). Application protocols that use application modules provide requirements
and information on the industrial use of the application modules that are the
data specification for the application protocol. The audience for this document
is ISO 10303 application module and modularized application protocol developers.
<p>Figure 1 contrasts the architecture of an application protocol that uses
application modules with the initial application protocol architecture.

<p>&nbsp;
<h3><a name="ap_introduction"><!-- --></a>4.1 The introduction</h3>
<p>The Introduction for the AP shall provide an overview of the technical
content and explain how the AP can be used for industrial activities. The
Introduction may include a planning model that provides a high level description
of the concepts supported by the AP. If present, this model shall have boxes
with the concepts named and lines connecting those concepts that have some
relationship. The planning model does not describe the relationships, e.g.
meaning, cardinality, or direction. For APs designed as part of a suite of
harmonized APs, the Introduction shall explain the overlaps and interfaces
between the APs. The planning model may be used to illustrate these overlaps and
interfaces.
<h3><a name="ap_scope"><!-- --></a>4.2 The scope</h3>
<p>Clause 1 of an AP shall define the domain of the AP and summarize the
fundamental concepts and assumptions of the scope, the functionality of the AP,
and the types of information that are accommodated by the AP. A description of
the functionality and information that are specifically outside the scope of the
application shall be defined to clarify the domain of the AP.
<p>The scope and requirements identify the primary concepts and relationships to
be supported by the AP. The definition of the scope and information requirements
begins with the formulation of a statement of the application protocol
functional requirements. This statement shall define the type(s) of information,
the life cycle stages supported, the discipline views of the data that are
within scope, the data application(s), and the use of the data within the
application(s) targeted for the AP. The detailed scoping and information
requirements definition shall follow from this statement.
<p>For clarification, the scope statement may also identify the type(s) of
information, the type(s) of products, the application processes, the types of
product data, and the discipline views of the data that are outside of the
scope.
<p><small><b>NOTE</b> - The scope of an AP is often based upon an activity
model. Activities, inputs, controls, outputs, and mechanisms may be determined
to be in scope for the AP. The inclusion of mechanisms, e.g., resources and
tools, in an AP should be carefully analyzed. Only those mechanisms that are
organization and enterprise independent should be included in the scope of an
AP.</small>
<h3><a name="normative_references"><!-- --></a>4.3 The normative references</h3>
<p>All normative references shall be listed in clause 2 of an AP. Normative
references may be dated or undated ISO 10303 standards as appropriate for the
AP. The minimal required set of normative references are as follows :
<p>ISO 10303-1 <i>Industrial automation systems and integration - Product data
representation and exchange - Part 1: Overview and fundamental principles.</i>
<p>ISO 10303-11 <i>Industrial automation systems and integration - Product data
representation and exchange - Part 11: Description methods: The EXPRESS language
reference manual.</i>
<p>ISO 10303-31 <i>Industrial automation systems and integration - Product data
representation and exchange - Part 31: Conformance testing methodology and
framework: General concepts</i>.
<p>ISO 10303-41, <i>Industrial automation systems and integration — Product
data representation and exchange — Part 41: Integrated resources: Fundamentals
of product description and support</i>.
<p>ISO/IEC 8824-1:1995, <i>Information technology - Open systems interconnection
- Abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) - Part 1: Specification of basic
notation.</i>
<p>The normative references shall include the application module directly used
by the application protocol.
<h3><a name="ap_definitions"><!-- --></a>4.4 The definitions and abbreviations</h3>
<p>Clause 3 of an AP shall include definitions of all concepts necessary to
understand the Introduction, Scope, and Information requirements clauses. This
clause may include concepts that are defined further in the Information
requirements clause. The concept definitions provided in this clause shall be
consistent with the complete definitions provided in the Information
requirements clause.
<p>This clause shall contain at least three subclauses: list of terms defined in
ISO 10303-1 and used in the AP, terms defined in the AP, and abbreviations and
symbols used in the AP. This clause shall list the terms defined in other ISO
standards, including AMs, that are necessary for understanding the AP. Should
the AP require industry specific terminology for any of the ARM concepts found
in AMs, this clause shall contain the definitions of those industry specific
terms.
<h3><a name="information_requirements"><!-- --></a>4.5 The information
requirements</h3>
<p>Clause 4 of an AP shall describe the information requirements of the AP. The
first paragraphs of this clause provide a high level description of the
information requirements that are supported by the AP and a summary of the
structure used to partition the information requirements. This clause may
include a description of the types of information supported by the AP, any
restrictions on the information supported, and the supported uses of the defined
information. This clause shall provide all additional information on the
fundamental concepts and assumptions (initially introduced in clauses 1 and 3)
which is necessary for complete understanding of the information requirements
and the scope boundaries. This clause shall include subclauses for the data
specification and industry specific terminology.
<p>This clause may include a data planning model which describes the primary
concepts of the ARM and the relationships among the concepts. The planning model
is at a high level of abstraction and does not include details such as
cardinalities of relationships. The planning model follows no specific
methodology. The data planning model may include the UoFs of the AP and is used
to introduce the detailed requirements provided in the referenced application
module. If an application activity model is present, this clause shall include a
note that refers the reader to the annex containing that model. If an
application reference model is present, this clause shall include a note that
refers the reader to the annex containing that model that explains the relevance
and roles of the required information.
<h3>4.5.1 The industry specific terminology</h3>
<p>If an AP specifies industry specific terminology, it is documented in 4.1 of
the AP. The correspondence between the industry specific terminology and the
terminology defined in the ARMs of the AMs comprising the AP shall be included.
An informative ARM corresponding to the scope of the AP may be defined and may
be represented using industry terminology. This representation of the ARM shall
not modify the data or relationships documented in the ARM other than by
renaming those data and relationships. If specified in the AP, the EXPRESS-G
diagrams and EXPRESS for this informative ARM shall appear in annexes, not in
clause 4.
<p>The industry specific terminology is specifed as an untitled, two column
table without borders with the left column having the module term and the right
column having the industry term. The table shall be introduced with the
following text &quot;For the purposes of this part of ISO 10303, the following
industry terminology applies where the first term is that found in the ARM of
the &lt;insert AM name here&gt; AM and the second term is the industry specific
term.&quot;
<h3>4.5.2 The data specification</h3>
<p>Clause 4.2 of an AP shall specify the application module that is the data
specification for the AP. The referenced application module may use other
application modules. Using an application module as the data specification for
the AP enables the use of the entire data specification for an AP in a
larger-scoped AP.
<p><small>EXAMPLE - Figure 3 shows how ISO 10303-233 (AP233) might be a modular
application protocol extending the scope of ISO 10303-203 Edition 2 (AP203)
based on AP 233 using the application module that is the data specification for
AP 203 and other application modules interpreted into the integrated resource
schemas.</small>

<p align="Center"><b>Figure 3 - AP233 using AP203 the application module</b>
<p>&nbsp;
<h3><a name="conformance"><!-- --></a>4.6 The conformance requirements</h3>
<p>Clause 5 of an AP shall specify the conformance requirements on
implementations of the AP. Conformance classes that are subsets of the data
specification of the AP may be defined. A conformance class is specified as a
list of application modules that specify the entities included in the
conformance class. With the exception of the application module that is
normatively referenced by the AP in 4.2, if an application module appears in the
list that is the basis for a conformance class , all application modules used by
that application module shall also appear in the list. The conformance class
specification may also include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a list of rules appearing in the MIM of an application module that do not
    apply for the conformance class, if any;
  <li>a list of ARM entities defined in the application module referenced in 4.2
    of the AP that are not included in the conformance class, if any. Any
    resource construct entity appearing in the MIM only as the result of the
    mapping from one of the ARM entities in the list is not included in the
    conformance class.
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<h3><a name="annexes"><!-- --></a>4.7 The annexes and bibliography</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>A Implementation method specific requirements (normative)
  <dd>This annex shall contain additional requirements for the specified
    implementation methods. For example, an AP to be used with Part 21, requires
    the schema name of the AP to be specified in the header section of a file.
    The required schema name for the header section would be specified in Annex
    A of the AP.
    <p>The implementation method specific requirements shall be in addition to
    those listed in the AP's conformance requirements clause. This annex may
    specify the meaning of values not given in the normative clauses. If no
    implementation specific requirements are specified, this fact shall be
    stated in this annex.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <dt>B Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) proforma
    (normative)
  <dd>This annex shall contain the PICS proforma that explicitly defines the
    implementation flexibility, if any, allowed by the application module
    specification. The PICS proforma is given in the form of a questionnaire to
    be completed by the supplier or implementor of an implementation of the AP
    before it undergoes conformance testing. The PICS proforma shall cover all
    optional functions, preparation procedures for the conformance assessment
    process, parameters, and other capabilities identified in the AP. The
    completed questionnaire shall be used by conformance testing laboratories
    for abstract test case selection and parameterization.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <dt>C Information object registration (normative)
  <dd>This annex shall specify the information object identifier for the
    application protocol document.

  <dt>D Application activity model (optional and informative)
  <dd>This annex, if provided, shall contain the application activity model
    (AAM) that provides a representation of the application context of the AP
    and of the activities which use product data in the application context.
    AAMs are mechanisms for scoping the information requirements for individual
    APs and for planning the development of nested APs. The AAM shall be
    represented in IDEF0.
    <p>The AAM includes the definition of the inputs, controls, outputs, and
    some of the mechanisms of those activities. Only those mechanisms that are
    organization and enterprise independent shall be included.
    <p>The first paragraphs of this annex shall explain the context of the AAM
    and summarize the assertions on which the AAM is based. The definitions for
    all activities and information flows in the AAM shall be provided in D.1,
    and the IDEF0 diagrams shall be provided in D.2.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <dt>E Application reference model diagrams (optional and informative)
  <dd>This annex, if provided, shall contain the application reference model
    diagrams corresponding to the entire scope of the AP. If industry
    terminology was specified in clause 4, the application reference model shall
    apply those industry specific names to the application objects and
    attributes defined in the ARM but shall not change the structure or meaning
    of the model.
    <p>The ARM shall be documented by use of EXPRESS-G. The ARM diagrams,
    together with the AP scope statement and the ARMs of the AMs comprising the
    AP, should be sufficient for a person familiar with the application to
    understand the AP domain.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <dt>F EXPRESS listing (informative and optional)
  <dd>This annex, if provided, shall contain a reference to a URL providing
    access to a file with the EXPRESS representing the ARM using industry
    specific terminology described, should such terminology be included in the
    AP.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <dt>G Application protocol implementation and usage guide (optional and
    informative)
  <dd>This annex, if provided, contains informative guidance on implementing and
    using the AP. This annex provides guidance to two different audiences, i.e.,
    implementors and end users of AP compliant implementations. Example
    information descriptions that are supported by the AP and the corresponding
    AP exchange files may be included in this annex. If exchange files are
    included in this annex, the annex should explain the primary data structures
    and the logic and meaning of the values used in the exchange file.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <dt>H Technical discussions (optional and informative)
  <dd>This annex, if provided, contains a summary of relevant technical
    discussions and the resolution of issues raised during the development of
    the AP. This annex provides background information for potential users of
    the AP and for developers of similar or related APs. The material given
    should not cast doubt or self justify. Only material which supports the
    normative text shall be given.
    <p>&nbsp;
  <dt>Bibliography (optional)
  <dd>This lists all informative references relevant to the AP.
