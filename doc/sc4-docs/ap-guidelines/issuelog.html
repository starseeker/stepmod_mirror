<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>3 rd paragraph, 2 nd sentence: Delete &quot;An&quot;, capitalize Application.
Delete the word &quot;informative&quot; before information, add &quot;the&quot;
before &quot;application modules that are &quot;</p>

<p>3 rd paragraph: Add a note following this paragraph or another sentence that
states the relationship of this document to &quot;Guidelines for the development
and approval of STEP application protocols.&quot; The sentence should be to the
effect that this document does not supersede that document, but may be used by
&lt;whom&gt; to develop modular APs on a pilot basis (or whatever the case is).</p>
<p>PROPOSED RESOLUTION - Rejected. If approved this Standing Document along with
the other two that are out for ballot at the same time will be a normal SC4
process, no longer a pilot or experiment. For modular APs, any provision in this
Standing Document does supercede the non-modular AP guidelines. 4 th paragraph:
Replace &quot;provides&quot; with &quot;illustrates&quot;, change
&quot;and&quot; to &quot;an&quot;, change &quot;compared&quot; to &quot;in
contrast&quot;, and consider changing the word &quot;current&quot; to something
else. (Isn&#146;t this also a &quot;current&quot; architecture? Perhaps
&quot;initial&quot;?)</p>

changes and deleting some of the unnecessary text.</p>

<p>1 st paragraph: Delete SC4 before standing document. I also prefer the phrase

definitive than &quot;using&quot;. It is phrased that way in some places but not
most.</p>

<p>Last bullet: How about &quot;specification of presentation requirements for
documenting ISO 10303 application protocols. This leads to the larger issue:
Where are the presentation requirements for modular APs specified? Ideally, the
requirements should be written in a form that could be easily spliced into the
SD. The requirements could be published as an annex to this document or as a
separate document. They should be published by this project because there are no
other resources to do so.</p>

</b>
<p>Last paragraph &#150; Recommend delete the deprecation of the standing document.
No reason to deprecate document. Deprecation should be SC4 resolution, not by
issuance of another method. WG10 has always stated that they are going to leave
the current process for developing SC4 standards alone and provide an
alternative method.</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-07 Rejected. It is the intent of WG10 to strongly encourage
that no new AICs be created. It is WG10's understanding that deprecating the
guidelines discourages but does not forbid the use of that guideline to create
new AICs.</p>

<p>Figure 1 (and text calling out Figure 1) indicates that the &#145;Modular STEP

not true, personnel can use either method for AP development.</p>

<p>Clause 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, etc.</p>
</b>
<p>This should point to the current AP Guidelines document and not re-iterate
the same contents.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this may need to be included in the current AP Guidelines
document. It appears that most of the information is a repeat of (or additional
information to) the current guidelines document &#150; should add the nominal
change information to the AP Guidelines document.</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-07 Rejected. The problem is that the current AP guidelines mix
content and process into a single document. For STEP modularization, WG10 has
chosen to separate the AP content from the AP development/standardization
process and has produced two separate Draft Standing Documents for ballot, one
that addresses AP content and the other that addresses the development process</p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<hr>
</font>
<p><b>Clause 4.5.1</p>
</b>
<p>The sentence states that this clause is an application module. It appears
that you have to have a module approved that is the scope of the AP prior to
starting the AP approval process. Is this what you mean? OR do you mean that the
clause has the same content and format as a module?</p>
<p>If the answer is that a module has to be approved first, this is a problem.
If the AP review process indicates that there is a minor change to the AP, then
there would be a change to approved module. The module would have to go out for
ballot and get approved prior to the AP going to the next stage. Is this the
intent?</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-07 Rejected. The document as stated is correct. The AP and the
AM that is the data specification for the AP are two separate, but obviously
related, documents. They are developed in parallel. The reason for this split is
to allow what's depicted in Figure 3, the use of one AP's data specification
directly by another AP's data specification.</p>

<b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<hr>
</font>
<p>General Question</p>
</b>
<p>Where is the EXPRESS for the short and long form? The short form may be a few
lines, but needs to identify what versions of documents/schema are used &#150;
configuration control. Long form is needed to identify what is required
(including the TCs that have are part of the modules) &#150; configuration control.
This information needs to be normative in the document.</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-07 The EXPRESS short form is in the AM. If the need for a long
form is agreed, the current approach would put this in the AM that is the data
specification for the AP.</p>
<b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<hr>
</font>
<p>Summary</p>
</b>
<p>Big issues are:</p>
<p>1) The need for EXPRESS for long and short form.</p>
<p>2) The need to have the content of the AP module contained within the AP.
This should not be a separate document that has to be approved separately.</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-07 The AP/AM separation is the agreed WG10 approach. The
EXPRESS appears in the AM. The requirement for a long form currently does not
appear in the AM. This point should needs to be raised and addressed as part of
the AM guidelines and the approach in general..</p>

<p>The architecture gives the impression, that an AP based on AMs just consists
of CC, AM List, AAM and reference to AM.</p>
<p>The diagram should depict all the relevant content as described in section
4.5 (i.e. ARM, :) and clearly state if an AP has a reference to exactly one AM

<p>CLOSED 2000-11-08 Accepted/Rejected. Added InfRM for &quot;informative
reference model&quot; to the diagram. Don't understand the confusion about the
referenced AM. The figure text says &quot;Norm Ref to AM&quot; where AM is
singular and the arrow in the figure points to exactly on AM. The reason the ARM
is not included is that it is not normative and it was felt that it would add
some confusion to the diagram since ARM in the AP would not mean the same thing
as ARM in the AM.</p>

<p>Guidelines for the development process for APs using AMs are out of scope.</p>

<p>Clause 4.5</p>
</b>
<p>Reading the document I understand that it is a fundamental principle that an
AP references exactly one AM.</p>
<p>If this assumption is correct I don&#146;t see a need to describe the
information requirements in the AP again. This cannot be more than a duplication
of what is in the AM.</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-08 Rejected. The repeat of the information requirements in the
AP is optional but is allowed if for some reason industry wants it. It does make
sense to include it if industry terms are used in an ARM used for educational
purposed, not implementation. The idea in the Introduction is to provide enough
information for a user/implementor to decide whether the AP is of interest or
not without having to look at the suite of AMs.</p>

<p>Clause 4.5</p>
</b>
<p>UoFs were originally defined to structure the information requirements of an
AP and to provide a grouping mechanism to define conformance classes.</p>
<p>Which role does UoFs play in the modular architecture? As an AP is now just a
reference to a top level AM I don&#146;t see a way to define a UoF structure.</p>
<p>Are the UoFs in any way related to <i>clause 5 conformance requirement</i>s?</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-08. UoFs are not related to conformance in the modular
architecture unless there is a one-for-one AM per UoF. Also note, that the
guidelines do not require that AMs are small. It is possible to create very
large AMs (as large as an AM today) and in that case, a UoF structure might be
useful.</p>

<p>Is it realistic to expect to have two or more APs with the same application

<p>I expect that two APs always will have different requirements which will
result in different objects and rules and therefore different top level AMs.</p>

<p>Clause 4.6</p>
</b>
<p>By definition, an Application Module is a thing which can be used as a whole,
only.</p>
<p>Excluding entities and rules by an AP looks very strange for me.</p>
<p>Removing a rule, for example, may change the intended semantics of a rule.</p>
<p>A conformance class states which application modules are included, i.e.
modules within the framework of the modules can be excluded.</p>
<p>What happens if an included module references a module which is not included
in a specific conformance class?</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the exclusion of entities and rules happens on ARM or
MIM level.</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-08 Accepted. Modified text to clarify how to specify a
conformance class.</p>

<p>How is the ARM of the AP related to the ARM of the AM?</p>
<p>Same layout, correspondence by visual coincidence?</p>
<p>Or is the AP&#146;s ARM stand-alone?</p>
<p>CLOSED 2000-11-08. The structure and relationships must be the same with the
only difference being names and the relationship between names is specified in
the industry terminology section. The ARM in the AP can appear differently as
far as how it is presented is concerned if that is what the AP developers decide
is most useful.</p>
