# EXPRESS MODEL DECLARATION MODULE

# This set of declarations defines the EXPRESS-2 Model as of the
#      date shown in the Formal Public Identifier (FPI) for this entity.
# 
#      This set of declarations may be referred to using a public external
#      entity declaration and reference as shown in the following two lines:
# 
# <!ENTITY % express.model PUBLIC "-//TC184 SC4//DTD EXPRESS Model 20010901">
# %express.model;
# 
#      If the parameter entity description.content used within this set 
#      of declarations is to be given non-default values, the appropriate 
#      declaration should be given before calling in this package 
#      (i.e., before the "%express.model;" reference).

The STEP Modules Repository is a collection of reusable XML building
blocks for developing standards from information models defined in
EXPRESS. An integral part of the repository's XML vocabulary is its
representation of EXPRESS language constructs, i.e. its EXPRESS
model. This specification shall refer to this EXPRESS model portion of
the repository's XML vocabulary as <emphasis>STEPmod
EXPRESS</emphasis>.

STEPmod EXPRESS was originally defined using a DTD. However, this
specification uses RELAX NG syntax because RELAX NG is better able to
represent co-occurrence constraints between XML attributes, and most
of the information in STEPmod EXPRESS data is in XML attribute values
rather than in element content.

STEPmod EXPRESS takes a middle-of-the-road approach regarding the
level of granularity of the XML markup with respect to to the EXPRESS
language. High level EXPRESS structures such as data types, their
attributes, and inheritance relationships are marked up. Expressions,
on the other hand, are not. As a result, STEPmod EXPRESS is suitable
for applications such as EXPRESS schema browsers as well as partial
mappings to other modeling languages such as UML and OWL.
