        The issue being raised against an Application Protocol document.
        If the type identifies the XML primary XML element that the issue
        is against:

        ballot
         This is the  ballot in which the issues was raised (if it was)
         e.g. "PLCS DIS ballot"
        
        ballot_comment_id
         This is the ID for the issue in the ballot. If the ballot issue results in a SEDS, the                issue ID will become the SEDS id, therefore, may get renumbered to. The
        ballot_comment_id is used to retain the original ballot comment id for auditing purposes.
