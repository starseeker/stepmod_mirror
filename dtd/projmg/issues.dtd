<!-- 
        The issue being raised against a module.
        If the type identifies the XML primary XML element that the issue
        is against:

        arm arm_lf mim mim_lf 
          then the issue is against express so the linkend attribute is 
          the identification of the express construct. The value is a
          structured string:
           <schema>.<entity|type|function|procedure|constant>.<attribute>|wr:<whererule>|ur:<uniquerule> 
           e.g.  work_order_arm.activity.name

        armexpg_lf mimexpg_lf
         then the issue is against an expressG diagrams.
         The linkend attribute indicates the expressg file

        mapping_table
         Then the issue is a against the mapping specification.
         the linkend attribute is the identification of the mapping spec.
         This is defined by flattening the element nodes.
         i.e. deleting all <> and "          
         The attributes entity, attribute and assertion_to should be
         specified. Use the = sign but deleting all "
         e.g.
          ae entity=Assigned_document_property 
         e.g
          ae entity=Product_design_to_individual aa attribute=individual_product assertion_to=Product_as_individual

        ballot
         This is the  ballot in which the issues was raised (if it was)
         e.g. "PLCS DIS ballot"
        
        ballot_comment_id
         This is the ID for the issue in the ballot. If the ballot issue results in a SEDS, the                issue ID will become the SEDS id, therefore, may get renumbered to. The
        ballot_comment_id is used to retain the original ballot comment id for auditing purposes.
