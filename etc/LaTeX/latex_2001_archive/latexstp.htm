<h1>LaTeX, the Web, and ISO standards</h1>
<h3>Peter Wilson</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    For some ten years now parts of ISO 10303, commonly known as STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data),
have been typeset using LaTeX. This has involved writing a new class for ISO standards in general, and new packages for
STEP in particular.

<p>
    More recently, ISO have been moving towards accepting electronic versions of standard documents instead of, or as well as,
the traditional paper camer-ready copies. They also appear to becoming interested in the possibilities of Web-based publication,
in the sense that HTML and PDF electronic sources are mentionable. LaTeX sources are ideal for this as the same document
source can be converted into PostScript, PDF and HTML formats for viewing, printing or publishing.

<p>
    I have been developing and maintaining the LaTeX STEP class and package files for the last several years. The production
versions of these are obtainable from <a href="http://www.nist.gov/sc4/editing/latex">SOLIS</a>. New versions are available
as described below. Following from ISO's interest in Web type publication the new versions have been "tweaked" to better
support the conversion of LaTeX documents into PDF and HTML formats. 

<p> 
    There are several ways in which a LaTeX document can be used as the basis for Web publishing; the best source for
information on these and the concomitant tools is Michel Goossens and Sebastian Rahtz, <i>"The LaTeX Web Companion:
Integrating TeX, HTML, and XML"</i>, Addison-Wesley, 1999. Much shorter is Peter Wilson, <i>"A Brief Guide to LaTeX Tools for Web Publishing"</i>. This  is available as the original <a href="http:latex/webguide.tex">.tex</a> source, and as generated <a href="http:latex/webguide.ps">PostScript</a>, <a href="http:latex/webguide.pdf">PDF</a>, and <a href="http:latex/webguide.html">HTML</a> format files. The Brief Guide in particular discusses using pdfLaTeX to generate a <code>*.pdf</code> file directly from a <code>*.tex</code> source file, and on using the TeX4ht program to convert a <code>*.tex</code> source file to an <code>*.html</code> HTML tagged file.
 
<p>
    Following are some of the LaTeX resources for ISO and STEP documents. The resources are usually packaged as two files: a <code>*.dtx</code> file and a corresponding <code>*.ins</code> file. These are both ASCII files. To extract the LaTeX, or other, code, run <code>latex</code> on the <code>*.ins</code> file. To print the documented source code, which usually includes the User Manual, run <code>latex</code> on the <code>*.dtx</code> file as if it were a normal <code>*.tex</code> file.

<h2>ISO class and packages</h2>

<p>
    Code for the ISO class is in <a href="http:latex/isoe.dtx">isoe.dtx</a> and <a href="http:latex/isoe.ins">isoe.ins</a>. As well as giving conformance to ISO's typesetting rules the class provides much of the boilerplate text that goes into any ISO standard. The User Manual for the ISO class is separate and is available as either the <a href="http:latex/isoman.tex">latex source</a> or as a <a href="http:latex/isoman.pdf">PDF</a> file.  The source code for the User Manual can be taken as an example of the use of the class and package.


<p>
There is also a special version of the <b>rotating</b> package, called the <b>isorot</b> package,  which is in <a href="http:latex/isorot.dtx">isorot.dtx</a> and <a href="http:latex/isorot.ins">isorot.ins</a>. The User Manual is separate and is available as either the <a href="http:latex/rotman.tex">latex source</a> or as a <a href="http:latex/rotman.pdf">PDF</a> file. 


<p>
Finally, there is a special version of the <b>supertabular</b> package, called the <b>xtab</b> package,  which is in <a href="http:latex/xtab.dtx">xtab.dtx</a> and <a href="http:latex/xtab.ins">xtab.ins</a>. 


<h2>STEP packages</h2>

<p>
    There are several packages that support the typesetting of the STEP standard documents, as well as many files that contain most of the required boilerplate text. All of these are in <a href="http:latex/stepe.dtx">stepe.dtx</a>, together with the <a href="http:latex/stepe.ins">stepe.ins</a> installation file.

<p>
    The User Manual for all the packages is provided as <a href="http:latex/stepman.tex">latex source</a> or in printable <a href="http:latex/stepman.pdf">PDF</a> format.

<h2>TeX4ht Configuration files</h2>

<p>
    Eitan Gurari's <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html">TeX4ht</a> system converts LaTeX tagged source to HTML tagged source. It requires configuration files which basically tell TeX4ht what HTML to insert into the source instead of LaTeX commands.  In fact it is more general in that configuration files can be written for conversion to XML tags, or for the addition of any ASCII text.

<p>
    The system comes with a broad collection of configuration files, essentially one for each common LaTeX class or package. The ISO/STEP resources, though, are uncommon in this respect. I have developed appropriate files for conversion of ISO and STEP LaTeX source to HTML documents. As usual, these are in <a href="http:latex/iso4ht.dtx">iso4ht.dtx</a> and <a href="http:latex/iso4ht.ins">iso4ht.ins</a> for the ISO class and packages, and in <a href="http:latex/step4ht.dtx">step4ht.dtx</a> and <a href="http:latex/step4ht.ins">step4ht.ins</a> for the STEP packages.

<h2>Miscellaneous packages</h2>

<p>
    The ISO/STEP LaTeX resources have been through many modifications over the years. This has been due partly to the ever-changing requirements, particularly for STEP, and partly through realisations of better ways of doing things. For example, specific code has been included for typesetting the Table of Contents. At some point this was generalised and put into a package because it was painful on both the LaTeX developers and the document authors to have to keep modifying things every few months. (The ToC is currently stable so it's now back to specific code). The following packages have all had their genesis from the ISO/STEP work. They are all available from CTAN (the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network) in the directory <code>macros/latex/contrib/supported</code>. There are three CTAN sites, one in <a href="ftp://ftp.dante.get/tex-archive">Germany</a>, one in the <a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive">UK</a> and one in the <a href="ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive">USA</a>. CTAN supports on-the-fly taring/zipping of both files and ditrectories.
