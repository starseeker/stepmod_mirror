Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Problems in the mapping

Problem Description: 
One mapping in Elemental_geometric_shape module have syntax error: 
cartesian_transformation_2d.multiplication_matrix

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
Mapping of cartesian_transformation_2d.multiplication_matrix has syntax errors. Proposal:
(* OLD mapping 
cartesian_transformation_operator_2d <= cartesian_transformation_operator
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis1 -> direction]
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis2 -> direction] *)
(* NEW *)
cartesian_transformation_operator_2d <= cartesian_transformation_operator
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis1 -> ]
[cartesian_transformation_operator.axis2 -> ] 
direction
