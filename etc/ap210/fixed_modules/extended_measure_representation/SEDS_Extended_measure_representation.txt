Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Problems in the mapping

Problem Description: 
One entity mapping in Extended_measure_representation module has syntax errors: 
Measure_item_with_precision.

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
Extended_measure_representation module.
1) Entity Measure_item_with_precision is declared to be mapped to [/SUPERTYPE(Measure_item)/][qualified_representation_item]. But attribute mapping starts with 
qualified_representation_item. This shows that [/SUPERTYPE(Measure_item)/] is fully redundant and even incorrect. 
So mapping of this Measure_item_with_precision entity should be declared as qualified_representation_item.
