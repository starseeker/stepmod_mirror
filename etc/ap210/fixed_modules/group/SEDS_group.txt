Section 2.  ENHANCEMENT AND DISCREPANCY INFORMATION (completed by Author of SEDS Report):

Author: Giedrius Liutkus
Email Address: giedrius.liutkus@lksoft.lt
Part and Clause where Issue Originates: ISO/TS 10303-1113, clause 5.1
Other Parts Affected by the Issue: 
Related Issues:
Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Some mappings in group module have syntax errors: Group entity mapping, Group.membership_meaning attribute mapping .
Problem Description: 
Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.
Proposed Solution (Optional):
1) Mapping of group has such an alternative - [group][applied_group_assignment].
This is wrong. It is really mapped to group and applied_group_assignment is just a constraint in a path.
So mapping should be declared just to group.
2) mapping of Group.membership_meaning should be modified to be started with group:
(* GL ADD *)
group <- group_assignment.assigned_group
group_assignment => applied_group_assignment
(* GL END *)
applied_group_assignment
applied_group_assignment <= group_assignment
group_assignment.role -> object_role
object_role.name
