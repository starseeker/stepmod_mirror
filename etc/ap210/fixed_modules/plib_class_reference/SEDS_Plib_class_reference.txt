Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Mapping requires to change one select in mim.

Problem Description: One select in Plib_class_reference module MIM schema needs be changed as required by the mapping: 
plib_class_organization_item.

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
1) Plib_class_reference.supplier_bsu - mapping uses class as it would be a member in a select organization_item.
But there's no module extending organization_item with class (or supertype group).
Proposal - Add select extension into plib_class_reference_mim.

Change 

TYPE plib_class_organization_item = SELECT BASED_ON organization_item WITH 
   (externally_defined_class);
END_TYPE; 

To 

TYPE plib_class_organization_item = SELECT BASED_ON organization_item WITH 
   (class);
END_TYPE;
