Summary/Abstract/Keywords: mim misses extension of select.

Problem Description: 
Some mappings in Project module require extension of one extensible select in mim:
event_occurrence_item. One more entry point - organizational_project should be added.
Currently this extension esists in product_data_management schema, but project module can be used without it, directly, so this 
extension should be added to project module.

	
Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
Add the following extention of select into Project_mim.exp

TYPE project_event_occurrence_item = EXTENSIBLE GENERIC_ENTITY SELECT BASED_ON event_occurrence_item WITH 
   (organizational_project);
END_TYPE; 

Remove similar extention from product_data_management_mim.exp
