module ==> altered_part
issue against: 
<description>
For Tom
Need to add Programmed_packaged_part which references software_definition to this module. Maybe model it with a programming relationship in order to keep the stepmod style. The subtype is not an Altered_package_part subtype.  Ok to leave the altered_packaged_part subtype alone since we are using it in production.  Otherwise will have to remove the redeclared attribute from altered_packaged_part (should not make it optional.) and have to make altered_packaged_part ABS.

module ==> assembly_component_placement_requirements
issue against: 
<description>
For Lothar
This module appears to be incomplete.  
There is no reference to Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence that I can see and acpr_requirement_assignment_item does not appear to be used.  If this module is intended to use Lsro, then when that is added, the intro and scope will need to be updated to reflect category to category relationships
looks like the Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence needs to be cloned
and the pca_product_design_object_category needs to be cloned.
maybe put pca_product_design_object_category clone in assembly_technology.

For Lothar

  END_ENTITY; 
</p>
<p>
    This AO is a copy of product_material_composition_relationship from part 45.
    I know of no application in electrical design where we have an explicit tolerance
    on bulk material in a bom.  suggest a subtype of Scr with a amount: SET[1:1]
    to support that case.
    also, need an ip that states that the members of amount (when there are more than
    one) need to be different complex instances of Value_with_unit and qualified_measure_schema AOs.
      I don't know where the requirement that Value_with_unit shall only be a ratio.

module ==> fabrication_technology
still to be updatd as of 1-25:
Design_layer_technology
Stratum_technology
<description>
For Jurgita--english descriptions provided, need to update arm.xml and descriptions.xml
  </description>

module ==> feature_and_connection_zone
issue against: Feature_and_connection_zone_arm.Connection_zone IPs
still to be updatd as of 1-25:

For Jurgita
add correct xml in arm.xml to show up IPs in browser.

module ==> layered_2d_shape
issue against: Layered_2d_shape_arm.Part_template_or_physical_unit_2d_shape_representation_relationship
<description>
For Tom
  The following where rule is missing and is needed (split into two rules for ease of coding).
 WR2: principal_part_shape and related_part_shape shall be for the same definition
or item and shall exist in the same Cartesian_coordinate_system.
  </description>

  </description>

---------------------------------------------------------
module ==> layered_interconnect_module_3d_shape
issue against: 
<description>
For Lothar
Not all these AOs may be in a 3d shape arm. (i.e., cutout)  This severely limits the capability of 2d design.  The critical AOs probably need to be split.(example::Inter_stratum_feature_edge_segment_template?)

module ==> packaged_part_black_box_model
issue against: Packaged_part_black_box_model_arm.Packaged_part
<description>
2005-01-26---still not moved.
For Jurgita
Figure 1 does not belong in this module.  It belongs in packaged_part_white_box_model
  </description>

---------------------------------------------------------
module ==> part_template_extension
issue against: Part_template_extension_arm.Trace_template
<description>
For Tom
Figure 1 does not belong here.  (There is too much detail in the figure that is not supported in the model of Trace_template.  Maybe on Printed_part_cross_section_template, which does have support for this level of detail.  Also a reference could be in routed_printed_component.

module ==> physical_connectivity_definition
issue against: Physical_connectivity_definition_arm.termination_or_junction
<description>
2005-01-26
For Jurgita
add description to get_terminals:
The function returns the set of terminals that are associated with the 
Physical_connectivity_definition that is the input to the function.

module ==> physical_connectivity_definition

For Tom
A formal definition is needed for "tree structure" and for Steiner tree.

For Viktoras
wr1,2,3,4 have wrong direction (relating,related in English description,
express is correct.
need to add descriptions for new rules

module ==> requirement_decomposition
issue against: Requirement_decomposition_arm.Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship
<description>
For Tom
  References to Requirements_group_occurrence could not be resolved, I can't find any place that
  entity is defined in a module at this time. This probably needs some work to harmonize
  with the pending AP233 view of requirements.
  </description>

---------------------------------------------------------
module ==> requirement_decomposition
issue against: Requirement_decomposition_arm.Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship
<description>
For Tom
<p>There is no actual possibility for the structure as defined to actually represent the application of an operation to the two operands since there is no possibility for the result to be referenced.</p>
<p>proposal:  Make Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship a subtype of Requirement_view_definition.</p>
<p>Then the result of the operation would be a subtype of the operand and that would allow it to be easily added to the Requirement_collection_relationship.</p>
<p>  ENTITY Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship</p>
<p>SUBTYPE OF (Requirement_view_definition);</p>               
      <p>relationship_type               : relationship_operation;</p>
<p>      relating_requirement_occurrence : requirement_view_definition;</p>
      <p>related_requirement_occurrence  : requirement_view_definition;</p>
<p>    WHERE</p>
      <p>WR1 : relating_requirement_occurrence :&lt;&gt;: related_requirement_occurrence;</p>
<p>      WR2: SELF :&lt;&gt;: relating...</p>
<p>      WR3: SELF :&lt;&gt;: related...</p>
<p>  END_ENTITY; -- operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship</p>

<p>(two new rules added)</p>
<p>The mapping would be to an AP210 entity: operational_requirement_occurence_relationship, which would be a subtype of product_definition and product_definition_relationship.
</p>

module ==> requirement_decomposition
issue against: Requirement_decomposition_arm.relationship_operation
<description>
For Tom
Whith the change proposed in issue TRT-1, it is no longer valid for one of the relationship types to be derived from.  If derived from is still needed in this module, it needs to be a separate Requirement_view_definition_relationship subtype itself, since the operation relationship is now actually a representation of an operation and derived from is not an operation.

module ==> signal
issue against: Signal_arm.Signal_property
<description>
For Lothar
The definition of this ao does not correspond to that in wd48_8.  A table is required to support capture of the ordinate and the measure value.  A list does not suffice.
<p>
  ENTITY signal_property
    SUPERTYPE OF (composite_signal_property)
    SUBTYPE OF (managed_design_object);

module ==> specification_document
issue against: Specification_document_arm.Structured_text.content_markup
<description>
For Lothar
There seems to be a mismatch between the text and the ARM, but I am not too sure
how to adjust it. It appears the attributes of External_source_identification have
changed significantly from whatever the original ARM attributes were.
