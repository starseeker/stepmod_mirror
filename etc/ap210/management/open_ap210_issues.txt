module ==> altered_part
issue against: 
<description>
For Tom
Need to add Programmed_packaged_part which references software_definition to this module. Maybe model it with a programming relationship in order to keep the stepmod style. The subtype is not an Altered_package_part subtype.  Ok to leave the altered_packaged_part subtype alone since we are using it in production.  Otherwise will have to remove the redeclared attribute from altered_packaged_part (should not make it optional.) and have to make altered_packaged_part ABS.

issue against: 
<description>
For Lothar
This module appears to be incomplete.  
There is no reference to Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence that I can see and acpr_requirement_assignment_item does not appear to be used.  If this module is intended to use Lsro, then when that is added, the intro and scope will need to be updated to reflect category to category relationships
looks like the Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence needs to be cloned
and the pca_product_design_object_category needs to be cloned.
maybe put pca_product_design_object_category clone in assembly_technology.

  </description>

2005-02-14 email with Lothar:

most of this makes sense.
One remaining problem.

From the module:

An Substance_composition_relationship is a type of Assembly_component_relationship. An Substance_composition_relationship is the association between a Part_design_view and Material_identification for the purpose of bulk material callout. 
NOTE    This application object is intended solely to support raw material callout whose shape is not explicitly modeled in the product model. 
EXAMPLE    Solder identified as a bonding agent may be aggregated for the assembly using this Application Object. 

The above description indicates that the reason for the AO is to include it in a design view.  However, the definition of the attributes

constituent: specifies the Substance for which the ratio given by quantity applies to. 
whole: specifies the Substance that serves as 100% for the ratio given by quantity. 
composition_basis: specifies the kind of ratio given by quantity. 
determination_method: specifies the LOGICAL type for the Substance_composition_relationship. This type permits a user to specify that the quantity of material to be supplied with the product may be determined at assembly on an item by item basis, where the item referred to is a real product delivered to a customer. 

indicate that the AO is actually specifying a composite material (e.g., the composition of solder).
So the question now is:
How to specify the bill of material relationship of solder to a design view?

Meanwhile this entity is a subtype of Assembly_component_relationship
and this has a quantity attribute so that old attribute amount got
removed.

Assembly_component_relationship.quantity is not a SET

> I don't know where the requirement that Value_with_unit shall only be a ratio.

Simply because "whole" is 100%. A Substance_view_definition can not
have a weight or volume. One may buy a bottle Bourbon of a given
volume - this is a part. But the chemical_substance alcohol has no
volume.

Please have a look to attribute determination_method. I can't remember
where this comes from. maybe it can be removed.

<description>
For Tom
Whith the change proposed in issue TRT-1, it is no longer valid for one of the relationship types to be derived from.  If derived from is still needed in this module, it needs to be a separate Requirement_view_definition_relationship subtype itself, since the operation relationship is now actually a representation of an operation and derived from is not an operation.
