module ==> ap210_assembly_functional_interface_requirements
issue against: 
<description>
This module uses from the assembly_physical_interface_requirement_arm. It isn't clear why this is so.
for Giedrius
maybe this is a typo and it should be assembly_functional_interface_requirements_arm??

<description>
For Lothar
Is this module necessary? The intro states that it is a superset of all the other ap210_assembly_xxx_requirements.
If the intro is correct, the scope, keywords, and USE_FROMs need to be updated.

For Giedrius
Why the reference here to a white box model? This is a black box model module.

For Giedrius
The following USE FROMs are to be removed and placed where specified (or deleted):
<p>USE FROM Functional_decomposition_to_assembly_design_arm; 
(move to ap210_assembly_functional_requirements)

USE FROM Functional_decomposition_to_design_arm; 
(delete this use from)

USE FROM Functional_decomposition_to_interconnect_design_arm; 
(move to ap10_interconnect_functional_requirements)

USE FROM Functional_decomposition_with_nodal_representation_to_packaged_mapping_arm; 
(move to ap210_assembly_functional_requirements)
</p>

module ==> ap210_interconnect_requirement_allocation
issue against: 
<description>
For Lothar
This module appears redundant to ap210_interconnect_functional_requirements in combination with ap210_interconnect_physical_requirements.  How is it justified by itself?  Until this is resolved, we don't need to bother with boilerplate.

module ==> assembly_functional_interface_requirement
issue against: 
<description>
For Giedrius
This module refers to assemly_physical_interface_requirement_arm.  It should not.
Tom updated the issues.xml to identify specific AOs to move to 
assembly_physical_interface_requirements_arm to support this.
