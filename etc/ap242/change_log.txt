About bug 3565 - Splitting Default_setting_association out into it's own module 
--- changes not yet committed in bugzilla ---
2011-06-19
Added AM Default_setting_association to CR9 and global index
committed initial module.

Bug 4122 - Draughting_annotation_occurrence is not a representation
------------
Comment #2 From Lothar Klein 2011-06-13 12:24:20 (-) [reply] -------

Today Tom, Ed and I agreed to remove AO Draughting_annotation_occurrence and to
change Explicit_schematic_element_definition.explicit_parts to be of type
Annotation_occurrence.

In addition we agreed to remove global rule draughting_model_items_constraint
from AM Dimension_and_tolerance_callouts because
draughting_annotation_occurrence and draughting_elements don't provide
added-value. Instead we may consider to add similar rules on draughting_model
(after AP242-CD ballot)

Bug 4116 - shape_definition_representation to shape_aspect/_relationship for the ARM
------------
On 2011-06-13 Tom, Ed and I decided for the following changes:

AM Property_assignment_arm:
Name the Property_definition_representation attributes identical to the corresponding IR entity.

AM Surface_condition_arm
- the current combination of 
   Surface_condition_property <= Assigned_shape_property
   Surface_contiotion_association <= Shape_dependent_property_association
   Surface_condition <= Representation
  is far too detailed and does not provide any added value.
  Decided to replace this by just one AO
    Surface_condition <= Assigned_shape_property
  and be done.

AM Feature_and_connection_zone_arm
- the above changes caused side effects on function facz_get_sc
- Turned the derived attribute Definitional_shape_element.surface_conditions
  into an INVERSE attribute
- removed function facz_get_sc

Change draughting_model_item_association.used_representation to use annotation_representation_select
instead of only draughting_model. So this entity can use all representations with annotations and it
also solves a SHOTOLO issue on unused select annotation_representation_select

Extend draughting_model_item_definition select and its "supertpye" item_identified_representation_usage_definition for
all the items that we need to relate it to, see AP212 presentation_select
examples:
- person_organization_assignment
- date_time_assignment ...


2011-07-06
Created new AM Product_as_individual_assembly_and_test_arm witht he AOs
- Product_as_individual_assembly
- Product_as_individual_test_result
  replacing physical_instance_test_result put on a product_definition level with a special additional conext
  physical_instance_test_result has a mapping error in constraining prodpert_definition.name but also enforcing a general_property.
  The intermediate general_property_association enforces that both general_property and property_definition must have the same name.
  For the new Product_as_individual_test_result all properties will be treated as "test results".

Moved Part_view_definition_context from AM Product_and_manufacturing_information_view_context to Part_view_definition
- added where rule and fixed/completed some where rules of subtypes
Added new subtype Process_state_view_context and new AO Process_state_relationship in AM Process_plan
product_and_manufacturing_information_view_context/arm.exp 1.3
process_plan/arm.xml 1.5
part_view_definition/arm.exp 1.13
added AM part_view_definition to CR9

Results from discussions with G�nter and afterwards:
kinematic_path needs an optional placement_start that must be present if path_nodes are used.
Made kinematic_path abstract and introduced two subtypes:
- kinematic_path_defined_by_nodes: all segements are path_nodes and so also a placement start is needed
- kinematic_path_defined_by_curves: all segements are curve_based_path_with_orientation 
Added a TOTAL_OVER subtype constraint to enforce that either a path_node or a kinematic_path_defined_by_curves is used.
Note that path_parametrization is 	


Process_state_relationship.relation_type
Permissable values
- assemble
- disassemble
- manufacturing step

process_plan/mim.exp  1.6
kinematic_motion_representation_schema.exp 1.17
kinematic_motion_representation_schema.exp 1.18

2011-07-09
The TOTAL_OVER introduced above is not a real good solution. 
Looking again to this it becomes clear that path_parametrization should simply be a subtpye of curve_based_path_with_orientation.
And while doing so renamed it to curve_based_path_with_orientation_and_parameters.
Now it is is clear that this subtype is only be used if un addition to the position and orientation curves additional parametric curves are needed to control thinks like speed, rotation speed, preasure etc.

 #503=REVOLUTE_PAIR_WITH_RANGE('pair-X','',$,#512,#522,#402,*,*,*,*,*,*,0,180);

This is correct, but it indicates another principle issue.
kinematic_pair and so all it's subtype have now two name attributes.
This is not usefull. Decided to block one of them by re-declaring it as derived:
  ENTITY kinematic_pair ...
    SUBTYPE OF (item_defined_transformation, geometric_representation_item);
    ...
  DERIVE
    ...
    SELF\item_defined_transformation.name : label := SELF\representation_item.name;
  ...
  END_ENTITY;
As a reult of this the example changes to
#503=REVOLUTE_PAIR_WITH_RANGE(*,'pair-X',#512,#522,#402,*,*,*,*,*,*,0,180);

-----
This is correct because of kinematic_link_representation_association.wr1.
I corrected this.
However looking to the rule it becomes clear that in combination with a transformation it should
be allowed to have different contexts. So changing to:

ENTITY kinematic_link_representation_association
  SUBTYPE OF (representation_relationship);
  SELF\representation_relationship.rep_1 : kinematic_link_representation;
  SELF\representation_relationship.rep_2 : shape_representation; 
WHERE
  WR1: (SELF\representation_relationship.rep_2.context_of_items :=:
        SELF\representation_relationship.rep_1.context_of_items) OR
       ('representation_schema.representation_relationship_with_transformation' IN TYPEOF(SELF)); 
END_ENTITY;

Bug 4018 on "Change request for AP242"
- added AM Design_management to AP242
- delete AO View_dependent_design_object_management_relationship
- removed Activity as a supertype of Design_object_management_relationship
- add attribute Design_object_management_relationship.described_change


2011-07-21
Yesterday Tom and I decided several changes on AM Design_management, see also bug 
- A Change can now be combined from several Change_elements and optionally an order between them may be defined.
- A Change_element is either an Add_, Delete_ or Modifiy_element
- Mapping of the whole is done to group and group_assignment, using similar names.
  Because change is already used by old AP203-ed1, had to call it change_group in the IR
Today I had further discussions with Juergen and we decided from a BO-Model perspective to
- introduce new AO Change_element_sequence, instead of an optional previous attribute on Change_element
- convert the previous and current attributes on Add_, Delete_ and Modify_element into a SET[1:?]
- introduce a new AO Modify_single_element 
Had to address side effects in AM Functional_decomposition_to_design, 410 and 442.

AM442
- added USE FROM Sketch

IR105 Kinematics:
Fixed errors in the example reported by Mikael / Yujiang Li:
#331=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_KINEMATIC_LINK_REPRESENTATION(#510,#330); change to
#331=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_KINEMATIC_LINK_REPRESENTATION(#513,#330);
 
#341=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_KINEMATIC_LINK_REPRESENTATION(#510,#340); change to
#341=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_KINEMATIC_LINK_REPRESENTATION(#523,#340);  

As a result of a discussions with Juergen added

log from Tom
--------
AM Change_management changes
updated to add aggregate position attribute to Change_element.
arm and mim express updated and successful long form build.

AM Appearance_assignment mim
Had to add
externally_defined_style to
USE FROM presentation_appearance_schema to get it brought into
longform due to shtolo limitation.

AM project
Had to make project_item GENERIC_ENTITY to satisfy shtolo/longform
generation process.

draughting_element_schema
added missing
REFERENCE FROM product_property_representation_schema (item_identified...)
[somehow this got left off of changes for text_reference stuff.]

With these changes I successfully built a mim longform.

added to CR9

- manifold_subsurface
- elemental_topology

Here some further explanation why I choose to introduce geometric_representation_select:

A Geometric_model (=shape_representation) is not the only kind of
Representation that can have a Geometric_coordinate_space
(=geometric_representation_context). There are
Kinematic_link_representation and Constructive_geometry that are not
Geometric_models in the sense that they represent the geometry of
something (e.g. a Part).

So I introduced the extensible select geometric_representation_select
that initially contain Geometric_model only and that is then extended
by Kinematic_link_representation. Didn't saw a need to extend it for
Constructive_geometry but a use case for this may come up later on.

So a
Geometric_model_relationship/Geometric_model_relationship_with_transfor
mation requires geometric_representation_selects for rep_1 and _2� to
make any sense. However a Link_motion_relationship requires for rep_1
only a Geometric_model or Kinematic_link_representation but nothing
else (e.g. Constructive_geometry).

-- later added
In light of the discussion above it become clear to me that also some kinds of  
Definitional_representations require a geometric_representation_context; 
in particular when they are used to define curves in U-V space (instead of X-Y).
So this is the reason why we have:
 ENTITY Path_parameter_representation_context
   SUBTYPE OF (Geometric_coordinate_space, Parametric_representation_context);
 END_ENTITY;

Tom replaced in 410 module the USE FROM to 403 by 442.
This caused name conflicts for the AOs cutout and marking.
Both are defined in AM Machining_feature but also in the AP210 specific modules AM Device_marking and AM Layered_interconnect_module_design respectively.
Decided to change in AM Machining_feature
- Cutout to Cutout_feature
- Marking to Marking_feature
machining_features/arm.exp 1.12
TBD - update description and mapping

bug 2682 1112 SEDS #1314: Miss configuration solutions
AM Effectivity_application_arm
- added ARM ineffectivity_assignment
effectivity_application/arm.exp 1.6

bug 3096 1010 SEDS #1406 extend date_or_date_time_select for extended dates  
AM Date_time_arm
- made date_or_date_time_select extensible
AM Extended_date_arm
- extended date_or_date_time_select by date_select 
- removed extended_date_time_select 
AM Basic_data_representation_arm

basic_data_representation/arm.exp 1.6
date_time/arm.exp 1.12
extended_date/arm.exp 1.5

AM Characteristic
- extended scope for 
  "identification of characteristics data in tabular form;"
- extended the introduction to say "single and tabular parameters"  
- added some overview information in clause 4; 
  not really sufficient, but better than nothing
- added mapping for Characteristic_data_table_header_usage  

Added to CR9:
- AM Effectivity_assignment
- AM Date_time
- AM Extended_date
- AM Basic_data_representation

During or after the SC4 meeting in Portland (my deskzilla copy of bugzilla was made just before)
the GD&T team agreed to deprecate symmetric_shape_aspect and as a consequence remove centre_of_symmetry.wr1.
Reason is that symmetric_shape_aspect does not provide additional semantic beyond what centre_of_symmetry is already doing.
If there is a centre_of_symmetry, then the one or several related shape aspects must be symmetric.
Solution is upward compatible because symmetric_shape_aspect is only depreacted, but not removed and old rule  
centre_of_symmetry.wr1 had anyway enforced that there could be no other related shape_aspects.
shape_aspect_definition_schema.exp 1.43

On yesterday's em-pilot call we decided for the top AP210 module AM 410:
- to be included in CR9 because there are so many changed ap210 modules and so this ensures that all is consistent.
- to USE FROM AM 442 instead of AM 403
- to not use new draft AM Schematic_symbol (comment it out). This will be added only after CR9.

Bug 3193 0403 Make Product abstract and its subtypes ONEOF
added exclusive_products_242 and extended exclusive_product_versions_242 accordingly
Note that Specification_based_product_version can be used in ANDOR combination
ap242_managed_model_based_3d_engineering/arm.exp 1.15

AM Design_product_data_management
- ARM added Retention_period along AP214
  because of AP233/239 can't add in lover level configuration modules
- MIM dito

Addressing bugs:
- 3961 xxxx AP214 AIM select comparison with AP203ed2 for AP242
Changes:
- removed in AM 442: action_item_242 = SELECT BASED_ON action_items WITH 
    (product_definition_formation_relationship);
  END_TYPE; 
- AM Design_pdm
  -- added design_pdm_action_item
  -- extended design_pdm_action_request_item
  
AM Text_appearance_arm
- added AO Defined_character_glyph and also in the ONEOF
- made composite_text_element_select extensible and added Defined_character_glyph
text_appearance/arm.exp 1.12

AM Work_request
AP214 has AO Work_request_relationship that maps to versioned_action_request_relationship.
This has so far been missing in setpmod. Decided to add this to AM Work_request.
work_request/arm.exp 1.19
work_request/mim.exp 1.17


2011-08-06/07:
Looking to the mapping of AP214 AO General_feature.additional_parameter
it becomes clear that this pattern is covered by AO Assigned_shape_property and
consequently be have to extend its attribute described_element for this.
The same mechanism is then covering General_feature.location_and_orientation

AM Shape_feature_arm
- adding new ARM/+MIM General_feature as a subtype of Shape_feature_element (taken from AP214)
shape_feature/arm.exp 1.18
shape_feature/mim.exp 1.10

AM Inertia_characteristics_arm
  REMIND: To be reviewed. 
  Most likely changes to fit with recommended practises and the re-arrangements in AM Shape_property_assignment are needed.
  See also no longer visible decriptions on AO Shape_dependent_property_representation (in arm_descriptions.xml)

AM Shape_property_assignment_arm
- renaming item_shape_or_element_or_relationship_select to assigned_shape_property_select and making it extensible
To reflect product_definition_shape.UR1 in the ARM
- adding UNIQUE for Item_shape.described_element
Change Shape_description_association.definition from Item_shape to Associated_item_change.
Only then the inverse attribute Associated_item_shape.association makes full sense.
updated mapping and description
shape_property_assignment/arm.exp 1.46

AM Contextual_shape_positioning_arm
Shape_placement_association.definition is so far of type Contextual_item_shape. 
But this conflicts with the changes of Shange_description_association.definition above.
So introduce new AO
    ENTITY Associated_contextual_item_shape
    SUBTYPE OF (Associated_item_shape, Contextual_item_shape);
and change the type of Shape_placement_association.definition to this.
Also removing the ONEOF between Associated_item_shape, Contextual_item_shape.
contextual_shape_positioning/arm.exp 1.17

P41:
I always have a bit problems to fully understand shape_definition_representation.wr1. 
But the normative text makes it clear: 
"A shape_definition_representation is the association of a shape_representation with a product_definition_shape or with a property_definition characterizing a shape_definition."
Decided to make this explicit by re-declaring the inherited definition attribute to be of type property_definition.
Note that a product_definition_shape is a property_definition as well.
So this ensures that this change will not affect any implementation or other Express models.
product_property_representation_schema.exp 1.27

Mikael reported an error on kinematic_property_mechanism_representation.wr1 which haven't been detected
before because this entity didn't show up in the AP242 long from so far. Fixed this.
kinematic_property_schema.exp 1.8

Mikael reported wrong order of SUPERTYPE OF statements in the case of multiple inheritence.
The issue is in stepmod XSLT where the supertype entities in a SUBTYPE OF statement are sorted alpabetically.
Decided to re-arrange the order in the entities instead of fixing the XSLT (several places).
Note that order is significant in a p21 file.
  ENTITY pair_representation_relationship
    SUBTYPE OF (geometric_representation_item, representation_relationship_with_transformation);

1- AM Assembly_physical_interface_requirement_arm
added Part_terminal
to
apir_requirement_assignment_item to satisfy
Protocol_requirement_allocation_to_part_terminal.assigned_to.
arm.exp v1.35

2- AM Package
changed Package_orientation_feature.wr1 to require
Package_orientation_feature to be a subtype of Datum_feature since
AO Datum_defined_by_feature is no longer in model.
arm.exp v1.83

3- AM Inertia_characteristics
corrected references in Centre_of_mass, Momentsof_inertia wr1, 2,3 (both 
AOs)
arm.exp v1.7

4- am Footprint_definition
fixed ref error in fd_get_amodel
arm.exp v1.37

5- AM Feature_and_connection_zone_arm
removed Connection_zone.wr1,
made Feature_definition_with_connection_area.connection_area
mandatory since the subtype doesn't need to be populated if the 
attribute is not populated.
arm.exp v1.37

6-AM Document_properties_arm
fixed syntax error in Document_property_representation.wr1
arm.exp v1.23

7- AM Assembly_component
made Assembly_component a subtype of Definition_based_part_occurrence 
instead of Definition_based_product_occurrence to resolve
attribute redeclaration scoping issue on
described_element.
arm.exp v1.3

9- SCHEMA mathematical_functions_schema
ECCO reports a missing bound_variable_semantics ENTITY TYPE.
This shows up in ENTITY TYPE quantifier_expression.
I could not easily locate the USE FROM that brought in 
quantifier_expression.
If this is important, it can be reviewed during CD.

I guess Process_operation_resource_assignment is meant which maps to an 
  requirement_for_action_resource <= action_resource_requirement
I guess we don't need a placement attribute here at all; 
but I see issues from the mapping and general concept.
Have to come back to this area again.

Added, and also added new AO Resource_requirement_type 
 for AP214 AO descriptive_specification

AM Mating_structure_arm
- renamed Mated_item_relationship to Mated_part_relationship
- added Mated_part_relationship to process_operation_input_or_output_select

> - bei same_time_machining_relationship fehlt das Attribut placement (opt.)
For the low-level modular ARM this has to be done a bit different through an Item_shape (in case of mapped_item) or an Contextual_item_shape.
For this purpose had to fix in
AM Shape_property_assignment_arm
- In select TYPEs shapeable_item and described_element_select replaced View_definition_usage but its supertype View_definition_relationship.
  This ensured that a same_time_machining_relationship can have an Item_shape or an Contextual_item_shape

Done

There is meanwhile Mated_item_relationship.mating_material, an opt. SET.
It was Quantified_instance, but now I changed this to Definition_based_part_occurrence
So it may still be quantified, but it must be "part" based

To address this I further extended the use of the new geometric_model_item.
It is now also used for
- Geometric_item_specific_usage.identified_item
- Associated_shape_element.associated_item
- and extended in AM Model_based_3d_geometrical_dimensioning_and_tolerancing_representation_arm
  for Connected_face_set, Edge_loop
Also in the nominal_3d_integral_feature_geometry select the element Manifold_subsurface_model is now replaced by Connected_face_set.

In AP214 AO Manufacturing_configuration.configured_element refers to Item_instance.
For AP242 Manufacturing_configuration maps to Item_usage_effectivity. 
Consequently Item_usage_effectivity.item_usage_relationship : item_usage_relationship_item  has to be extended for Part_occurrence.
Done in AM 442.

About AP214 general_organizational_data_select:
  copied to AM242 and updating all select members to the new types.
  Keeping the old types as comment for reference.

While reviewing the AP214 item_property_select and how it is captured in stepmod I figured out several issues that I had to correct:

Corrected extension of property_assignment_select:
- Shape_property_assignment_arm, new:
  -- Item_shape,
  -- Shape_element, 
  -- Shape_element_relationship
- Shape_feature_arm: reduced to
  -- Characterizable_object
- AM 442
  -- Product_class
  -- Product_specification (not Product_identification because this is not a characterised_object, can't map)

Adressing ARM compilation errors reported by Tom on 2011-08-01:
'concatenated_arm.exp': 19904, 81: Warning     : surface_condition type expected in inverse attribute (type is represented_definition)
LK: with the select extension spa_represented_definition this should no longer be the case

'concatenated_arm.exp': 18813, 72: Error       : identifier 'dimimension_count' not declared

          Externally_defined_view_definition);

Tom: I did notice that you didn't update the MIM for shape_feature:

Jamie Stori: dimensional_location_with_datum_feature and dimensional_size_with_datum_feature are missing in AP210/242
LK: Added 
dimension_tolerance/mim.exp 1.21

2011-09-04
Jami Stori indicated an error in dimensional_location.wr1. The copyarison operator ":=:" must be replaced by ":<>:"
LK: done

2011-09-05
Changed the order of attributes

Changed label of where rules to upper cases
extended_geometric_tolerance/mim.exp
machining_features/mim.exp

Tom wrote 2011-09-02:
cardinality of packaged_component.access_mechanism needs to be SET[0:?] OF packaged_component_join_terminal FOR associated_component so that
inconsistency between this attribute and Embedded_component_join_terminal.associated_component can be corrected.

2011-09-07
Jami and Viktoras reported issues with general_datum_reference in new p47:
There is a kind of conflic between wr1 and ur1 because it does not make sense to enforce that the name attribute must be an empty string and then to make it unique.
In long discussions the GD&T team has agreed that the (abstract) general_datum_reference shall be used by only one datum_system and in only one branch of the graph of referenced datums.
This is enforced in the subtypes of general_datum_reference. Because of this ur1 is now redundant. Removed it.

The other issue is with common_datum_list that must have at least 2 entries in the list. With only one it would not be a common datum. 
shape_aspect_definition_schema.exp 1.44

2011-09-11
Tom: 1-Property_assignment_arm
1a- 
TYPE property_assignment_select = EXTENSIBLE SELECT;
END_TYPE
The property_assignment_select should be GENERIC_ENTITY because it is 
impossible to assign a property to anything other than an ENTITY instance.
[We may want to defer this to DIS since I don't think it will cause a 
compiler issue.]

bug 4117: Extend Draughting_model_item_association for all related product data
Today Tom and I agreed to extend geometric_item_specific_usage_select and so also
item_identified_representation_usage_definition for all kinds of assignment entities
that can relate additional information to a product and that may show up on a drawing in some form.
  ap242_managed_model_based_3d_engineering/arm.exp 1.22

The last 3 modules are AP233/239 specific. And because the change is very minor decided to not update them now as part of CR9

2011-09-13
There was the following in ap242 mim.exp:
REFERENCE FROM product_property_representation_schema
  (item_identified_representation_usage_definition);
It is not allowed to use a REFERENCE FROM in a module MIM other than for functions so the declaration was changed to:
USE FROM product_property_representation_schema
  (item_identified_representation_usage_definition);   
ap242_managed.../mim.exp 1.23 

2011-09-14
Together with Tom we reviewed new ARM compilation errors:

Kinematic_property_mechanism_representation.WR1 is using wrong parameter for function call using_representations.
Updated the rule to fit with the recently updated IR105 rule.
kinematic_structure/arm.xml 1.8

Some rule is referring to Direction.direction_ratios which exisit in IR42, but not in the MIM AO.
Make Direction identical to IR42.
elemental_geometric_shape/arm.exp 1.21

Shape_element_relationship_representation_association.WR1 misses a schema name in a string-type.
assembly_feature_relationship/arm.exp 1.2

Coaxial_constraint.wr1 refers to "Point" which does not exisit on the ARM.
Decided to make ARM identical to IR42 - so adding Point (but as abstract supertype) 
and making Cartesian_point, Point_on_curve, Point_on_surface subtypes of it (with extra ONEOF).
Consequently removed no longer needed point_select, but this caused several side effects

Kinematic_link_representation_association.wr1 includes invalid schema name

Gdt_representation_view_context and Model_based_3d_annotation_presentation_view_context had incomplete rules
product_and_manufacturing_information_view_context/arm.exp 1.7

Numeric_expression_arm: There are many erros because "functions" from other plib20 wrapper modules are called out,
but the corresponding modules are not available. So had to add
	USE FROM Numeric_function_arm;
	USE FROM Expression_arm;
numeric_expression/mim.exp 1.2 
numeric_expression/arm.exp 1.3

2011-09-16
Tom detected an issue with the ARM of AM Sketch.
The select type surface_or_solid_model is defined there but is empty.
But when looking to IR108 we can see that it contains different kind of models,
not all of them are available on the ARM level. Decided to 
- add USE FROM Solid_model_arm/_mim;
- change surface_or_solid_model into GENERIC_ENTITY
- add Solid_model to the select 
sketch/mim.exp 1.5
sketch/arm.exp 1.8

2011-09-18 
Tom: (2011-09-19 change log updated to more accurately reflect actual state of local repository
used to create arm longform.)
Detected syntax and other errors and corrected them.
(the definition of a syntax error may seem arbitrary but it is simply
what doesn't get through one or more of the EXPRESS compilers. In some 
cases it is simple expediency to avoid endless editing of error reports.)

ap242_managed_model_based_3d_engineering/arm.exp
TYPE general_organizational_data_select
was changed to
TYPE general_organizational_data_select = EXTENSIBLE GENERIC_ENTITY SELECT.

A redundant 
Security_classification declaraction was removed from
general_organizational_data_select.
ap242_managed_model_based_3d_engineering/arm.exp v 1.19

The edit of Shape_element_relationship_representation_association.WR1 on 2011-09-14
deleted part of WR1. This was corrected.
Assembly_feature_relationship/arm.exp 1.3

Component_feature
Component_feature and
Component_feature_joint redundantly redeclared
Shape_element.element_name to be mandatory.
An earlier change in Shape_element.element_name made it already mandatory.
Component_feature/arm.exp 1.33

Elemental_geometric_shape
A previous change of Direction to use direction_ratios was incompletely propagated
to using entities.
Axis_placement,
Cartesian_transformation_2d and 
Cartesian_transformation_3d
were updated.
Elemental_geometric_shape/arm.exp 1.22

Expression
Changed capitalization on all references to Is_int_expr to agree with declaration.
(even though EXPRESS compilers may ignore capitalization.)
This will probably eliminate need for REFERENCE FROM Numeric_expression_arm(is_int_expr)
but I didn't test is so didn't remove it.

Previous efforts to fix USE FROM were incomplete.
USE FROM Generic_expression_arm was added.
Note that this fix is probably just a hack to get the longform build done and may be
revisited later.
Expression/arm.exp 1.31

Extended_date
Made contents of ed_date_or_date_time_select explicit rather than reference date_select.
This is a hack to make the EXPRESS compiler (don't remember which one) happy.
Extended_date/arm.exp 1.6

Feature_and_connection_zone
Made Connection_zone 
not ABSTRACT are there are no subtypes in AP 242.
Feature_and_connection_zone/arm.exp  1.38

Footprint_definition
changed Footprint_definition_shape_model.reference_shape to
be lict_physical_unit_shape_model_select to get just planar shape.
(This has nothing to do with ap 242 and is included here for convenience.)
Footprint_definition/arm.exp 1.39

Incomplete_data_reference_mechanism
replaced Incomplete_reference_marking.wr1 with explicit attribute in order to have
shtolo generate select type.
strictly speaking not an EXPRESS error but we have moved to this approach recently
in other modules.
Incomplete_data_reference_mechanism/arm.exp  1.16

Kinematic_motion_representation
added disambiguation to 
Kinematic_path.closed_path,
Point_to_point_path and
Linear_path
to reduce EXPRESS compiler complaints and associated manual processing during long form generation.
Kinematic_motion_representation/arm.exp 1.9

Kinematic_state
changed references from 'basis_xx' to 'supporting_xx' in several places as some previous
edit that changed to source did not update the references.
Kinematic_state/arm.exp 1.4

kinematic_structure
added 
  ks_property_assignment_select
and corrected
  Kinematic_link_representation_association.wr1
kinematic_structure/arm.exp 1.10

Kinematic_topology
disambiguated
Kinematic_topology_substructure.wr1,2.
Kinematic_topology/arm.exp 1.6

product_as_individual_assembly_and_test
added
paiaata_activity_item
product_as_individual_assembly_and_test/arm.exp 1.3

shape_data_quality_criteria
fixed a couple of spelling errors.
shape_data_quality_criteria/arm.exp 1.7

Numeric_function
corrected capitalization of reference to Is_int_expr
corrected Odd_function.wr1
Numeric_function/arm.exp 1.21

- cc6:  product as individual.

Updated AP242 clause 4.1 for new conformance options

2011-09-21
Today the GD&T group agreed to the following changes.
All Express changes have to wait till after the CD.

new ISO 5459:2011 related:
- agreed to add clarification in p47 and AM1051 on datum and datum_reference_compartment, and maybe datum_system
  A STEP datum_reference_compartment is close to what is now a datum in ISO 5459:2011.
  A STEP datum is not a datum in ISO 5459 sense. It only provided the identifier (e.g. "A") 
  and otherwsie serves a collector for the datum_targets and datum_feature.

- new ALS modifier any_longitudinal_section
  add it into both enumerations, like ACS is already
- new projected tolerance (P) symbol for datum reference compartments.
  Because the length may be included we decided to re-use projected_zone_definition.
  For this to happen we have to extend tolerance_zone_target select for general_datum_reference.
  There is currently no constrain on whether the (p) would apply only for the whole compartment 
  or only for a single referenced datum in a common datum.
  Because of this solution we decided not to have (P) in either 
  simple_datum_reference_modifier or geometrical_tolerance_modifier

add in geometric_tolerance_modifier "separate_requirement" for "SEP REQT" to be replaced.
This is to support ASME, and the following logic applies:
a) In the case that ASME Y14.5 is referenced, all geometric_tolerances
that refer to the same datum_system are considered to be a simultaneous requirement
b) The new separate_requirement flag overrides this for an individual geometric_tolerance (or a few)
c) And with geometric_tolerance_relationship.name = "simultaneity" this is overridden once more.
  A single chain is sufficient

- remove Situation_feature,

    plane_situation_feature : OPTIONAL Plane_shape_element;
    straight_line_situation_feature : OPTIONAL Axis_placement_shape_element;
  Note that the same situation feature Point_, Plane_ or Axis_... can be used by several Datum_reference_compartments
  Point_shape_element and Plane_shape_element are new subtypes of Associated_shape_element.
- require update of
Datum_plane users; use Plane_shape_element instead
          Datum_based_direction_element.base_datum_plane
          Datum_based_direction_vector.vector_of
          Datum_based_length_measure.of_datum
          Pre_defined_datum_plane_3d_symbol.associated_element  
Datum_axis users, use Axis_placement_shape_element instead
          Datum_axis_and_tolerance_zone_orienting_relationship.orienting_datum_axis
          Pre_defined_datum_2d_symbol.associated_element
          Pre_defined_datum_axis_3d_symbol.associated_element          

- new term collection-surface 
  agreed that it should apply only to composite_shape_aspects.
  For now to add it to the recommended practises.        

- Viktoras: Rules on datum_system, for specific kind of tolerances 
  Bryan explained that there are examples for all the tolerances where up to 3 datum reference compartments are needed.
  Decided that these rules have not been valid and that we don't want to get them back.

As agreed by the GD&T group updated Geometric_tolerance_arm.Geometric_tolerance_relationship.relation_type on "simultaneity"

-----
AM Shape_property_assignment_arm:
assigned_shape_property_select should not be extensible
so the generic mapping case has to be removed as well.

2011-09-23
Keith, Tom and Allison decided to remove AM Numerical_interface_mim because this
module defines some invalid MIM entities and it is only used in the top 442 modules.
So removing it and also the select extension   property_variable_rep_select_242.
I don't recall why it was added in the first place. 
ap242_managed_model_based_3d_engineering/mim.exp 1.24

Implementing the changes decided on 2011-09-21 related to ISO 5459:2011
shape_tolerance_schema.exp 1.36
shape_aspect_definition_schema.exp  1.45

add in p47 about reflex angle

Together in the team reviewed and update arm-descriptions of
- product_and_manufacturing_annotation_presentation
- product_and_manufacturing_information_view_context
- product_and_manufacturing_information_with_nominal_3d_models

2011-09-24
Implementing further changes decided on 2011-09-21
see log from today
geometric_tolerance/arm.exp 1.41
extended_geometric_tolerance/arm.exp 1.81
pre_defined_datum_2d_symbol/arm.exp 1.22
pre_defined_datum_3d_symbol/arm.exp 1.22
ap242_managed_model_based_3d_engineering/arm.exp 1.20

added separate_requirement to geometric_tolerance_modifier enumeration
shape_tolerance_schema.exp 1.37

sync mim USE FROMs with arm
change_management/mim.exp 1.3

In arm_descriptions of Altered_package_arm changed a link to datum_plane 
to "datum plane" because we removed this entity.

2011-09-25
Removing all arm-expg long form stuff from AM 442.
This caused 10000+ errors

Merge CR9 into CR7, resulting in double entry of AM
- sketch, edition 1
- basic_curve, (edition 3 published 2010-09-03) edition 4 (was 5)

- expression, edition 3 (was 1)
- generic_expression, edition 2 (was 1)
- numeric_function, (edition 1 published 2005-12-08 ), edition ??

As discussed at the last modules call the publication shall be in 2011.
So changed publication date to 2011-12-15 and year to 2011-12.

Today Tom and I decided to not include the below drafts for the AP242-CD / CR7:
TYPE unit_enum = ENUMERATION OF (
  unit_m,
  unit_mm,
  unit_inch,
  unit_mil,
  unit_um);
END_TYPE;
ENTITY Unit_property
  SUBTYPE OF (Assigned_shape_property);
  SELF\Assigned_property.described_element : Item_shape;
  unit : unit_enum;
END_ENTITY;
ENTITY Fractional_digits
  SUBTYPE OF (Assigned_shape_property);
  SELF\Assigned_property.described_element : Item_shape;
  no_of_digits : INTEGER;
END_ENTITY;
ENTITY Valid_deciminal_significant_digits
  SUBTYPE OF (Assigned_shape_property);
  SELF\Assigned_property.described_element : Item_shape;
  no_of_digits : INTEGER;  -- map to qualified_representation_item and  precision_qualifier
END_ENTITY;
geometric_tolerance/arm.exp 1.42

MIM USE FROMs had not been in synv with the ARM ones
expression/mim.exp 1.21

Removed in geometric_tolerance_mim the global rules
subtype_exclusiveness_geometric_tolerance  and
subtype_mandatory_geometric_tolerance because equivalent rules are
now in p47ed2.
geometric_tolerance/mim.exp 1.41

Fixed mapping of several modules:
- AM Assembly_technology
  fix mapping of Assembly_bond_definition.bonded_feature_1 and _2
- AM Functional_decomposition_to_design
- AM Change_management
- AM component_feature

2011-09-27

AM Mating_structure:
Tom, Allison, Jay Gentuli, Jochen, Keith, Mike and me decided to extend for further
mating types (soldering, friction welding) and for the mapping introduce a new
MIM entity mated_part_relationship that is a subtype of 5 IR concepts. 
mating_structure/mim.exp 1.3
mating_structure/arm.exp 1.6
  
Fix mapping in AM
- design_product_data_management

2011-09-29
Together with max updated AM442/AP242 scope

2011-09-30
Giedrius indicated that a mapping error on Geometric_tolerance.unequally_disposed_tolerance_zone_displacement
fixed this.

After some debate with Viktoras it become clear that some cases listed in ISO 5459:2011 
"table 2 Modifier Symbols" are not yet covered (only covered in other places).
So adding
  TYPE simple_datum_reference_modifier = EXTENSIBLE ENUMERATION OF
    ... 
    minor_diameter,
    major_diameter,
    pitch_diameter);
shape_aspect_definition_schema.exp 1.46

2011-10-01, LK
fixed mapping of
- AM Manifold_subsurface: Manifold_subsurface_model.items
- AM part_view_definition
- AM stratum_non_planar_shape: add mapping for Topologically_constrained_manifold_surface_shape_representation
- AM Surface_texture, many fixes to update for property_definition on a shape_aspect resp. product_definition_shape
  however the mapping of Contact_ratio.measuring_gauge to measuring_gauge_select/Part_view_definition is and was always wrong in my opinion.
  Here a proprety_definition is used in the opposite direction as it is intended to use.
  To fix this issue more background information of what a Contact_ratio really is is needed.
  Similar issue on Extended_visual_appearance.texture_map assertion_to="Digital_file" 
  Have also issues with Coating-layer. Further disucssions needed.
- AM default_setting_association
  We have to come back to this and the ARM to look to variations of the length values
  
 AM mating_structure: add description of new MIM entity mated_part_relationship
