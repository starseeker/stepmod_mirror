Part and Clause where Issue Originates: ISO/TS 10303-1001, clause 5.1.

Related Issues:

Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Multiple mapping syntax errors.

Problem Description: 

Multiple syntax errors in the following mappings:
Transformation_based_styled_model.replication_transformation (to Cartesian_transformation_2d) and
Transformation_based_styled_model.replication_transformation (to Cartesian_transformation_3d)
Both mappings have the following line:
representation_item -&gt; geometric_representation_item

This is incorrect as representation_item is not pointing to geometric_representation_item - it is its supertype.

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
Change
...
representation_item -&gt; geometric_representation_item
...

To
representation_item =&gt; geometric_representation_item
