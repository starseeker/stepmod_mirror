Part and Clause where Issue Originates: ISO/TS 10303-1111, clause 5.1, clause 5.2.
Other Parts Affected by the Issue: 
Related Issues:
Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Multiple mapping problems.

Problem Description: 
Some mappings in Classification_with_attributes module have syntax errors: 
1) Classification_attribute.allowed_values,
2) Classification_attribute,
3) Classification_with_attributes.version_id,
4) Classification_attribute.characterized_class,
5) Class_with_attributes.used_classification_system.
Some of the proposed solutions requires changes in mim as well.

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
Classification_with_attributes module:
1) 
a) Mapping of Classification_attribute.allowed_values has syntax errors:
represented_definition = property_definition
represented_definition <- property_definition_representation.definition
property_definition_representation.used_representation -> representation
{property_definition_representation.name='allowed values'}
representation.items[i] -> representation_item
representation_item => compound_representation_item
compound_representation_item.item_element -> compound_item_definition
compound_item_definition = set_representation_item
(* OLD 
set_representation_item[i] => representation_item *)
(* NEW *)
set_representation_item[i] -> representation_item 
(* END OF Changes *)
representation_item => measure_representation_item

b) Mapping of Classification_attribute.allowed_values has syntax errors (order of 2 lines is mixed):
represented_definition = property_definition
represented_definition <- property_definition_representation.definition
(* OLD *)
property_definition_representation.used_representation -> representation
{property_definition_representation.name='allowed values'}
(* NEW *)
{property_definition_representation.name='allowed values'}
property_definition_representation.used_representation -> representation
(* END of NEW *)
representation.items[i] -> representation_item
representation_item => compound_representation_item
compound_representation_item.item_element -> compound_item_definition
compound_item_definition = set_representation_item
set_representation_item[i] -> representation_item
representation_item => measure_representation_item

2) Mapping of Classification_attribute is declared to be mapped to [property_definition][general_property].
But it looks like it is mapped to property_definition, while general_property is a constraint only.
Proposal - change this mapping to be property_definition.
3) Classification_with_attributes.version_id - mapping uses class as it would be a member in a select identification_item.
But there's no module extending identification_item with class (or supertype group).
Proposal - Add select extension

TYPE classification_identification_item = EXTENSIBLE SELECT BASED_ON identification_item WITH
  (class);
END_TYPE;

4) Mapping of Classification_attribute.characterized_class contains syntax errors. Proposal:
property_definition.definition -> characterized_definition
characterized_definition = characterized_object
(* OLD *)
characterized_object <= characterized_class
(* NEW *)
characterized_object => characterized_class

5) Class_with_attributes.used_classification_system - mapping uses class as it would be a member in a select classification_item.
But there's no generic module extending classification_item with class (or supertype group).
Proposal - Add select extension

TYPE classification_classification_item = EXTENSIBLE SELECT BASED_ON classification_item WITH
  (class);
END_TYPE;
