Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Mapping of entity Colour is not precise enough.

Problem Description: 

ARM Colour mapps to AIM colour. But mandatory ARM attribute name mapps to attribute of specific subtype colour_specification (name).
Also mapping path of this attribute starts not with colour, but with colour_specification.
This is not allowed as well.

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
ARM Colour should be explicitly mapped to Colour_specification as mandatory attributes must be populated.
