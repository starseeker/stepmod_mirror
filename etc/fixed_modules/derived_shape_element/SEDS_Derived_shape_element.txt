Section 2.  ENHANCEMENT AND DISCREPANCY INFORMATION (completed by Author of SEDS Report):

Author: Giedrius Liutkus
Email Address: giedrius.liutkus@lksoft.lt
Part and Clause where Issue Originates: ISO/TS 10303-1130, clause 4.2.
Other Parts Affected by the Issue: 
Related Issues:
Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Attribute Derived_shape_element.role should be redeclared.

Problem Description: 
Mapping of attribute Derived_shape_element.role is overlaping with the mapping of Shape_element.description.
So on the ARM there are 2 different attributes, but on the AIM it is impossible to set different values for them.
So most logical solution is to make Derived_shape_element.role a redeclared attribute from Shape_element.description.

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
Make Derived_shape_element.role a redeclared attribute from Shape_element.description:
ENTITY Derived_shape_element
  SUBTYPE OF (Shape_element);
  derived_from : SET[1:?] OF Shape_element;
  SELF\Shape_element.description RENAMED role : STRING; (* CHANGED LINE *)
END_ENTITY;
