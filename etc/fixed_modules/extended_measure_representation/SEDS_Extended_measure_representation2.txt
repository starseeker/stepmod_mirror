Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Missing entity in MIM needed by the mapping

Problem Description: 
Some attribute mappings of ARM entity Value_with_tolerances uses qualitative_uncertainty as mapping target.
This entity is not accesible in the MIM of this module. So needed USE FROM has to be added.

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
Extended_measure_representation module.
Add use from of one entity:
USE FROM qualified_measure_schema   -- ISO 10303-45
  (...
   qualitative_uncertainty,
   ...
   ); 
This schema is already interfaced, so just one line needs to be added.
