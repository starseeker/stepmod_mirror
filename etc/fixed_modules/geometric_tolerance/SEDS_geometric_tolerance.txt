Section 2.  ENHANCEMENT AND DISCREPANCY INFORMATION (completed by Author of SEDS Report):

Author: Giedrius Liutkus
Email Address: giedrius.liutkus@lksoft.lt
Part and Clause where Issue Originates: ISO/TS 10303-1051, clause 5.1.
Other Parts Affected by the Issue: 
Related Issues:

Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Multiple mapping errors.

Problem Description: 
ISO 10303-1051 Geometric_tolerance

1) Mapping of Geometric_tolerance_relationship has redundant line which is not constraint at all

2) Target_area mapps to datum_target without any constraint. It is impossible to distinguish it on the AIM from other datum_targets.

3) Target_point mapps to placed_datum_target_feature without any constraint. It is impossible to distinguish it on the AIM from other placed_datum_target_feature.



Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
1) Instead of
<ae entity="Geometric_tolerance_relationship">
<aimelt>geometric_tolerance_relationship</aimelt>
<source>ISO 10303-47</source>
<refpath>geometric_tolerance_relationship
geometric_tolerance_relationship.name</refpath>

It has to be
<ae entity="Geometric_tolerance_relationship">
<aimelt>geometric_tolerance_relationship</aimelt>
<source>ISO 10303-47</source>
<refpath>geometric_tolerance_relationship</refpath>

2) 
Proposal, options: 
a) remove this entity from ARM.
b) have specific subtype on the AIM - Target_area (subtype of datum_target).

3) Proposal add a constraint, similar like in other subtypes of Placed_target:
placed_datum_target_feature &lt;= 
datum_target
{datum_target &lt;= 
shape_aspect 
shape_aspect.description = 'point'}
