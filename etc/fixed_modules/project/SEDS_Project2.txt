Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Mapping of Project.planned_start_date and Project.planned_end_date (to Event).

Problem Description: 
Currently the mapping of Project.planned_start_date (to Event) is as follows:
     <aa attribute="planned_start_date" assertion_to="Event">
       <aimelt>PATH</aimelt>
		 <refpath>
		   organizational_project
			 event_occurrence_item = organizational_project
			 event_occurrence_item &lt;- applied_event_occurrence_assignment.items[i]
			 applied_event_occurrence_assignment &lt;= event_occurrence_assignment
			 event_occurrence_assignment.role -&gt; event_occurrence_role
			 {event_occurrence_role.name='planned start'}
		 </refpath>
		 </aa>

Currently the mapping of Project.planned_end_date (to Event) is as follows:
     <aa attribute="planned_end_date" assertion_to="Event">
       <aimelt>PATH</aimelt>
		 <refpath>
		   organizational_project
			 event_occurrence_item = organizational_project
			 event_occurrence_item &lt;- applied_event_occurrence_assignment.items[i]
			 applied_event_occurrence_assignment &lt;= event_occurrence_assignment
			 event_occurrence_assignment.role -&gt; event_occurrence_role
			 {event_occurrence_role.name='planned end'}
		 </refpath>
		 </aa>		 


Mapping target of both attribute mappings is Event, but mapping path is not ending with corresponding AIM entity (event_occurrence).
Mappings are missing few lines:
event_occurrence_assignment.assigned_event_occurrence -&gt; event_occurrence

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):

Change the mapping of Project.planned_start_date (to Event) as follows:
     <aa attribute="planned_start_date" assertion_to="Event">
       <aimelt>PATH</aimelt>
		 <refpath>
		   organizational_project
			 event_occurrence_item = organizational_project
			 event_occurrence_item &lt;- applied_event_occurrence_assignment.items[i]
			 applied_event_occurrence_assignment &lt;= event_occurrence_assignment
			 {event_occurrence_assignment.role -&gt; event_occurrence_role (* Added "{" *)
			 event_occurrence_role.name='planned start'} (* Removed "{" *)
			 event_occurrence_assignment.assigned_event_occurrence -&gt; (* Added *)
			 (|event_occurrence|) (* Added *)
			 (event_occurrence =&gt; (* Added *)
			 relative_event_occurrence) (* Added *)
		 </refpath>
		 </aa>

Change the mapping of Project.planned_end_date (to Event) as follows:
     <aa attribute="planned_end_date" assertion_to="Event">
       <aimelt>PATH</aimelt>
		 <refpath>
		   organizational_project
			 event_occurrence_item = organizational_project
			 event_occurrence_item &lt;- applied_event_occurrence_assignment.items[i]
			 applied_event_occurrence_assignment &lt;= event_occurrence_assignment
			 {event_occurrence_assignment.role -&gt; event_occurrence_role (* Added "{" *)
			 event_occurrence_role.name='planned end'} (* Removed "{" *)
			 event_occurrence_assignment.assigned_event_occurrence -&gt; (* Added *)
			 (|event_occurrence|) (* Added *)
			 (event_occurrence =&gt; (* Added *)
			 relative_event_occurrence) (* Added *)
		 </refpath>
		 </aa>		 

Proposal is exactly matching current AP214 mapping.
