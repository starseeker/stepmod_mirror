# ballot
#  This is the  ballot in which the issues was raised (if it was)
#  e.g. "PLCS DIS ballot"
# 
# ballot_comment_id
#  This is the ID for the issue in the ballot. If the ballot issue results in a SEDS, the                issue ID will become the SEDS id, therefore, may get renumbered to. The
# ballot_comment_id is used to retain the original ballot comment id for auditing purposes.
