# Each issue file consists of a single issues element

# The issue being raised against a module.
# If the type identifies the XML primary XML element that the issue
# is against:
# 
# arm arm_lf mim mim_lf 
#   then the issue is against express so the linkend attribute is 
#   the identification of the express construct. The value is a
#   structured string:
#    <schema>.<entity|type|function|procedure|constant>.<attribute>|wr:<whererule>|ur:<uniquerule> 
#    e.g.  work_order_arm.activity.name
# 
# armexpg_lf mimexpg_lf
#  then the issue is against an expressG diagrams.
#  The linkend attribute indicates the expressg file
# 
# mapping_table
#  Then the issue is a against the mapping specification.
#  the linkend attribute is the identification of the mapping spec.
#  This is defined by flattening the element nodes.
#  i.e. deleting all <> and "          
#  The attributes entity, attribute and assertion_to should be
#  specified. Use the = sign but deleting all "
#  e.g.
#   ae entity=Assigned_document_property 
#  e.g
#   ae entity=Product_design_to_individual aa attribute=individual_product assertion_to=Product_as_individual
# 
# ballot
#  This is the  ballot in which the issues was raised (if it was)
#  e.g. "PLCS DIS ballot"
# 
# ballot_comment_id
#  This is the ID for the issue in the ballot. If the ballot issue results in a SEDS, the                issue ID will become the SEDS id, therefore, may get renumbered to. The
# ballot_comment_id is used to retain the original ballot comment id for auditing purposes.
