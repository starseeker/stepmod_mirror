      <p>When running any Java application, Saxon included, all Java classes that are needed must be present on the
CLASSPATH. The classpath can be set in the form of an environment variable, or it can be included in the <code>java</code>
command that invokes the application.</p>
      <p>The classpath is written as a list of filenames. These will either be the names of directories (folders) that contain relevant
classes, or the names of JAR files containing the classes. On Windows, the names in the list are separated by semicolons; on Linux,
a colon is used.</p>
      <p>The table above lists the JAR files provided with Saxon that you may need to include on your classpath. In addition,
you may need to include some of the following resources:</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
            <tr>
               <td content="para">
                  <p>

               <td content="para">
                  <p>License file. This is needed only for running Saxon-EE/Saxon-PE. The license file is
obtained when you purchase the product or when you apply for an evaluation license.</p>

               </td>
               <td content="para">
                  <p>This file implements parts of JAXP 1.4 that Saxon uses. It 
is not needed when you run Saxon under JDK 1.6, as the required classes are then included in the standard Java run-time. It is
needed, however, if you run Saxon under JDK 1.5. This JAR file is not included in the
Saxon distribution because of licensing restrictions. Instead, it must be downloaded from
<a href="https://jaxp.dev.java.net/" class="bodylink">https://jaxp.dev.java.net/</a>. The <code>jaxp-api.jar</code> file is needed when
you use the <code>StAXSource</code> class. </p>

            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Source code and documentation are not included in the same download file
as the executable code and sample files. Instead, they are in a resources file that can be downloaded separately. The documentation is
also available online.</p>
      <p>The source code for Saxon-HE (on both the Java and .NET platforms) is available in the package
 <code>saxon-resources-9.x</code> from either the SourceForge or the Saxonica sites. 
 Note that it is not necessary to download or 
 recompile the source code unless you need to make changes (and it is rarely necessary to make changes, because Saxon provides
 extensive system programming hooks to enable customization). The exception to this is that in Saxon-HE, adapters
 for external object models, and localization code for non-English languages, are provided in source form only.</p>
      <p>The modules included in the source code of Saxon-HE are
also used, without modification, in Saxon-PE and Saxon-EE. Source code for the additional components of the
commercial editions is not provided. The source code is the same between the Java and .NET platforms:
both products are generated from the same source, though there are some modules that apply only to one
platform or the other. There are no build scripts provided for rebuilding the product from source code, because
most users find it convenient to use their Java IDE for this purpose.</p>
      <p>User documentation (this documentation, together with API specifications for the Java and .NET products) is also
available for download from the SourceForge site. The download package contains exactly the same information as the documentation section of
the Saxonica website. It also contains this documentation in its original XML form, together with the schemas
and stylesheets used to publish it. Note that online documentation is available only for a few recent Saxon versions;
older versions can be downloaded from SourceForge.</p>
