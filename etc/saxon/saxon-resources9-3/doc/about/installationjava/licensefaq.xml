      <h1>Troubleshooting license key problems</h1>
      <p>If you are having trouble running Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE for the first time, here is a list of the
most common problems:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p><b>If your license key does not arrive</b> within 24 hours, it may be because it has been 
intercepted by your company's spam/virus checker. This is surprisingly common. Send us an email
and we will try to find a way through your company's defences.</p>
            <p>Another possible cause is that you provided an email address that doesn't work. Again, it's surprising how
many people do this.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And some less common problems:</p>
      <ul>
         <li content="para">
            <p>
               <b>Check that the filename is <code>saxon-license.lic</code>
               </b>. Some mail systems, notably Yahoo, 
have been known to change the hyphen to an underscore in transit.</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>
               <b>If Saxon says it cannot find the license key</b>, please read the instructions above for where to
  install the license key once again.</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>
               <b>If Saxon says that a particular operation requires Saxon-PE or Saxon-EE</b>, this may mean that you are
  running Saxon-HE software, or that you have invoked Saxon using a Saxon-HE entry point, or that Saxon has reverted
  to Saxon-HE functionality because it could not find a valid license file (in the latter case it will have produced
  a message to this effect: but depending on your application, you might not see the message).</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>
               <b>If Saxon says the license key is invalid</b> then it probably is. Very occasionally a license file
gets corrupted in transit. Please ask for another copy (or we might issue you a new license).
Sometimes the corruptions can be traced to the use of non-ASCII characters in license fields such as your name
or Company (mail systems can be unkind to such files). In the event of problems, try applying again restricting yourself to ASCII characters.</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>
               <b>If Saxon says the license key has expired</b> this generally means you are using a 30-day evaluation
license and the expiry date has been reached. If it's taking you longer to evaluate the software than
you planned, please send us an email explaining the circumstances before you apply for another license,
otherwise the request may be refused.</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>
               <b>If Saxon says the license key does not cover the version of Saxon that you are using</b>, this usually
means that you purchased a standard license key which covers free upgrades for one year, and that year has
elapsed. You will need to purchase an upgrade, which can be done online. Most paid-for licenses are
permanent, but only in relation to software issued within one year of the purchase.</p>
