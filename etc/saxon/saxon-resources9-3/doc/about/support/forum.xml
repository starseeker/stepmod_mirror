      <h1>Lists and forums for getting help</h1>
      <p>If you have a general question about XSLT or XPath programming, that is not
            specifically related to Saxon, we recommend the <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/" class="bodylink">xsl-list</a>: check first that the query
 isn't already covered in the FAQ. The archives of the list can be searched at 
 <a href="http://xsl-list.markmail.org/" class="bodylink">MarkMail</a>. Other useful sites for XSLT information are
 <a href="http://www.xslt.com/" class="bodylink">www.xslt.com</a> and 
  <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/" class="bodylink">www.jenitennison.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Similarly, there are a number of help forums for XQuery: for details see the
XQuery home page at <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query" class="bodylink">http://www.w3.org/XML/Query</a>.
The most active is <a href="http://www.xquery.com/" class="bodylink">talk at xquery.com</a>.</p>
      <p>If you have questions specific to Saxon you can usually get an answer by raising them on the Saxon
help list at <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help" class="bodylink">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a>. You will need
to register.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can also use the saxon-help forum on the SourceForge project site. Saxonica monitors
both; however, if you want to get input from other Saxon users, the mailing list is usually more
effective. You can also use the support-requests tracker on SourceForge; unlike the forum, this
allows attachments to be uploaded.</p>
      <div class="boxed"
           style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px">Please do not ask for help via the bug tracker on SourceForge. We prefer to keep this for confirmed
    bugs only. It's much easier to search it for known bugs if it isn't cluttered with support requests
    that are not bugs at all.</div>
