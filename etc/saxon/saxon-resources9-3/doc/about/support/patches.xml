      <h1>Bugs and patches</h1>
      <p>If you hit something that looks like a bug, please check the known errors on
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon" class="bodylink">the Saxon project pages at SourceForge</a>.
Also check the list archives.</p>
      <div class="boxed"
           style="border: solid thin; background-color: #B1CCC7; padding: 2px">Please don't enter the problem into the bug register until it
is confirmed as a bug: it's easier for everyone to search for real bugs if the register isn't
cluttered with problems that turned out not to be bugs at all.</div>
      <p>If you need to submit attachments, this is best done through the <b>Support Requests</b>
tracker on the SourceForge site.</p>
      <p>Saxon-EE and Saxon-PE users are provided with an email address that allows bug reports to be sent
to Saxonica privately if preferred.</p>
      <p>The open source code of Saxon-HE is maintained in a Subversion repository on the SourceForge site.
This exists solely to provide early access to source patches, it is not (currently) used to deliver
incremental releases of new functionality. Building the Jar files is reasonably easy for an experienced
Java programmer; an Ant script is provided to assist with this, but it is likely to require customization
to local requirements (for example, deleting the parts concerned only with Saxon-EE or Saxon on .NET). 
Building the .NET product is considerably more complicated, and although scripts are provided, 
you should only attempt it if you have a good knowledge of both platforms.</p>
      <p>If you wish to contribute modifications to the open source code, you will need to be prepared
            to sign a contributor agreement defining the terms under which the code is made available. This 
            may need the written agreement of your employer. You should also check with Saxonica in advance
            to discuss the format of test material to be submitted along with code changes; proposed 
            contributions have often been rejected because they came without adequate tests.</p>
