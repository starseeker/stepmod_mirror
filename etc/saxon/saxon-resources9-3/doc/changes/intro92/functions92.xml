      <h1>Functions and Operators</h1>
      <p>In regular expressions, the rules on back-references as defined in errata E4 and E24 have now been implemented. Backreferences
of more than two digits are now recognised; a back-reference is recognized as the longest sequence of digits after "\" that is
either one digit or is longer than the number of preceding left parentheses; a backreference must not start with the digit zero;
a backreference N is an error if it appears before the closing bracket corresponding to the Nth opening bracket.</p>
      <p>The rules for regular expressions in the draft XML Schema 1.1 specification clarify the ways in which hyphens may be used
within a character class expression (that is, within square brackets). To implement these rules, Saxon now disallows an
unescaped hyphen at the start or end of a character range (for example <code>[--a]</code>).</p>
      <p>The option <code>alphanumeric=codepoint</code> is now available in collation URIs to request alphanumeric collation (integers
embedded in the string are sorted as integers) with codepoint collation for the "alpha" parts of the string.</p>
      <p>The <code>collection()</code> function now allows directories of text files to be read, provided the text uses characters
  that are legal in XML. This is achieved using the additional query parameter <code>unparsed=yes</code> in the collection
  URI. The resulting files are returned in the form of document nodes, each having a single text node as a child.
  The platform default encoding is assumed.</p>
      <p><i>Since the <code>unparsed-text()</code> function is not available in XQuery, this also gives a way of reading
  unparsed text files from XQuery. Simply use <code>collection('file:/c:/my/dir/?select=filename.txt')</code>.</i></p>
