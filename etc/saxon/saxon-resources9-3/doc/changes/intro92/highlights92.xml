      <h1>Highlights</h1>
      <p>This page lists some of the most important new features introduced in Saxon 9.2.</p>
      <ul>
         <li content="para">
            <p>Saxon 9.2 requires JDK 1.5</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Saxon 9.2 comes in three editions: Home, Professional, and Enterprise, replacing the previous
split between Basic and Schema-Aware.</p>
            <ul>
               <li content="para">
                  <p>Home Edition (HE) includes most of what was in Saxon-B, with the exception of Saxon extensions
 and extensibility features</p>
               </li>
               <li content="para">
                  <p>Professional Edition (PE) includes everything that was in Saxon-B, plus some additional features
 previously only available in Saxon-SA, such as XQuery 1.1 support and higher-order functions</p>
               </li>
               <li content="para">
                  <p>Enteprise Edition (EE) is the successor to Saxon-SA, and includes all the capability of Saxon-SA
 plus new features introduced in Saxon 9.2.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>Configuration information can now be specified in an optional configuration file</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>A new mechanism for creating "integrated extension functions" is defined, removing the reliance
on Java reflection and the dependency on ad-hoc rules for conversions between XPath types and Java classes</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>Separate compilation of query modules in now possible (Saxon-EE only)</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>Support for XQuery Updates is aligned with the Candidate Recommendation</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>Selected features from the draft XQuery 1.1 Recommendation are implemented, notably Higher Order Functions</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>A number of Saxon extension functions have been reimplemented to use higher order functions, leading
 to a slight change in interface</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>More features from XML Schema 1.1 have been implemented, including "open content", and the ability
 for an element to belong to multiple substitution groups.</p>
         </li>
         <li content="para">
            <p>More capabilities are available for running transformations in streaming mode, in particular, it
 is now possible to traverse a streamed document using recursive template rules provided that the template
 rules are sufficiently simple.</p>
         </li>
