      <p><b>OpenJDK Classpath</b></p>
      <p>The copy of OpenJDK Classpath released with Saxon on .NET is a derived from the version
that is released as part of IKVM Runtime (see above). This in turn is derived largely from the Sun OpenJDK distribution,
together with some components taken from the Red Hat IcedTea library, compiled into CIL code using IKVMC.
Saxon 9.1 uses IKVM 0.40.0.1, which in turn uses OpenJDK 7 b13.</p>
      <p>Saxon distributes only the parts of this library that are actually needed. These parts have been rebuilt from source
code, but no source modifications have been made.</p>
      <p>Saxon links dynamically to this DLL.</p>

(This is a modified variant of the GNU Public License version 2,
with a special clause allowing it to be used as part of a product that is not itself open source.)</p>
      <p>Applicable notice: GPL+CLASSPATH.txt</p>
      <p><b>Apache Xerces</b></p>
      <p>Rather than distributing the Sun version of Xerces that comes with the OpenJDK library, Saxon instead distributes
the Apache version of Xerces. (The two versions have diverged considerably. The Apache version is used because it is 
considered more reliable and is also easier to integrate because it
does not have unnecessary dependencies on other parts of the JDK library.)</p>
      <p>The two Apache JAR files <code>xercesImpl.jar</code> and <code>resolver.jar</code> have been cross-compiled
to IL code using the IKVMC compiler, but are otherwise unmodified.</p>
      <p>The license conditions for Xerces are at

      <p><b>TagSoup</b></p>
      <p>Supporting the <code>saxon:parse-html()</code> extension function, the code of TagSoup version 1.2
 is included in the Saxon-PE and Saxon-EE distributions on .NET. Apart from cross-compiling from Java bytecode
 to IL code, the code is unmodified.</p>
      <p>Information about TagSoup, including links to the download location for source code, is available at
