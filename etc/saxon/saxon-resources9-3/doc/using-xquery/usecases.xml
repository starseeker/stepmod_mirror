      <h1>Use Cases</h1>
      <p>Saxon runs all the <a href="http://www.w3.org/xquery-use-cases" class="bodylink">XQuery Use Cases</a>.</p>
      <p>The relevant queries (some of which have been corrected from those published by W3C) are included
in the Saxon distribution (folder <code>use-cases</code>) together with batch scripts for running them.
A few additional use cases have been added to show features that would otherwise not be exercised.
A separate script is available for running the STRONG use cases since these require Saxon-EE.</p>
      <p>Also included in the distribution is a query <code>samples/query/tour.xq</code>. This is a query that
generates a knight's tour of the chessboard. It is written as a demonstration of recursive functional
programming in XQuery. It requires no input document. You need to supply a parameter on the command
line indicating the square where the knight should start, for example <code>start=h8</code>. The output
is an HTML document.</p>
