The application 'exppp' is from http://stepcode.org.
Here is a link to exppp: http://stepcode.org/docs/executables/#exppp
There is a specific version of exppp that is used:
Build info for exppp: git commit id: v0.7-353-g0a46b86,
http://github.com/stepcode/stepcode and scl-dev on google groups
The executable is rather small on the mac os x 10.11.x
cmake-gui v 3.5.2 was used to configure the build.

=======WARNING=========
This application is only provided for users to support comparing the released 409, 410, 442 longforms
 from 2014 to newer longforms because those published longforms were created by this executable (which
 has some anomalies. In order to simplify comparison, any longform to be compared with those longforms
 should also be processed by the exppp tool. Otherwise there will be too many differences caused by
 extra parantheses for the comparison to be productive.)
 
For newer editions, use the Express Engine --pretty function.
compiled binaries are available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/exp-engine/

============INSTALL=======
A separate directory should be provided for each os for which the exppp app is provided.
