<h2><a name="While"></a>While in GE</h2>

<h3>&nbsp;Eurostep logo&nbsp;</h3>

To eliminate the logo and&nbsp; incorrect title, cover with a rectangle in VISIO.
<p>or, alternatively &nbsp;after exporting as XML, crop the *.gif images (see
below).</p>
<h3>Required comments</h3>
<p>The best way to get to get static comments into arm.exp or mim.exp , is to go
to the schema page and click on main schema, then add them to the description
field.</p>
<p>Example:&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp; N773 - ISO TS - 10303-1042 Work request - EXPRESS MIM</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE : in above, any text after the colon and before the second dollar sign
  was added by CVS - I did not put it in... This is how it is supposed to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remark&nbsp; delimiters will be added to Express by GE export process.</p>
<h2><a name="Exporting">Exporting</a> from GE</h2>

<p>Export EXPRESS and Publish as XML.</p>

<p>Now run ge2module.wsf</p>

<h2><a name="Cleanup">Cleanup</a> of files after running ge2module.wsf.</h2>

<h3>.exp files:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Remove language version identifier if any.</p>

<p>Remove Eurostep comments.</p>

<p>Remove any extra schemas.</p>

<p>Add N number and cvs keyword - note : these can be added to the GE model once
instead of in outputs each time you must modfiy.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Express-G diagrams&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>armexp?.gif and mimexp?.gif</h3>

<p>If Eurostep logo is still visible,&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> crop the gif images, ( for example with&nbsp; Microsoft
    Photo Editor). Be sure to crop only bottom and right side, retaining
    original settings for top and left side. This will assure that image maps
    still work.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<h2>arm.xml and mim.xml</h2>

<p>Add&nbsp; to express element the attribute description.file = &quot;arm_descriptions.xml&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or &quot;mim_descriptions.xml&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>armexpg?.xml or mimexpg?.xml</h2>

<p>If there is no entity level diagram for the mim schema (or occasionaly the
arm schema) , replace the href in the image map with an href to the mim listing
in clause 5.&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE&nbsp; For Shape_property_assignment_mim: href=&quot;../shape_property_assignment/sys/5_mim.xml#mim_express&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="using"></a>Using GE 1.3.9 - tips to work around stability problems</h2>
<p>(From Rob)</p>
<p>Hi<br>
I have had several emails about GraphicalExpress being unstable.<br>
<br>
The software is not 100% reliable.<br>
<br>
Having used it for a while I now know where some of the bear traps are.</p>
<p>I don't think that the express import works that well - particularly on files with multiple schema.</p>
<p>Avoid the temptation to copy between different Visio diagrams - this can lead to the model being corrupted. Particularly if you copy USE FROM or PAGE REFERENCEs&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visio will nearly always crash if you publish as XML, then save as express. It successfully outputs the express then crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Editing the USE relationships between schema on the schema page can cause problems if you have selected the "Explicitly interface items"&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you resize the pages to make the model fit the smallest page, the image maps will be correct on Windows2000 - I am not sure what happens in other operating systems. NT for example will produce an offset image map. If you are using NT I would recommend leaving the page size as default and position the diagram at the top of the page so that it is visible in the module.</p>
<p>I always save my files a new version frequently so that I can go back to a previous version if the model gets corrupt. i.e. part_arm_v1.vsd&nbsp;<br>
part_arm_v2.vsd&nbsp;<br>
part_arm_v3.vsd  ....... etc&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never use the description facility in GraphicalExpress to describe the model. I always run publish my model as XML then run stepmod/utils/extractDescriptions.wsf to get a template for the descriptions in a module i.e. arm_descriptions.xml mim_descriptions.xml, then write them there.&nbsp;
The reason for doing this is that if I corrupt the model, it means that I still have the descriptions. Also, people other than me can update the descriptions.</p>
<p>Finally, there scripts for extracting the XML for modules and the help files that explain how to do this are at:
<a href="http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~robbod/">http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~robbod/</a></p>
<p>One other area where GE is sometimes unstable is the renaming of schemas. I have found that this sometime crashes
GE.&nbsp; My approach is to try to get me schema names correct first time ;-) If I do have to rename the schemas I rename them one at a time, saving into a new file each time so that I can roll back if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>(From SYL)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along this line, if one needs to correct the names of USE_FROM schemas, one should first undo all the Entities referencing the schemas and then do the corrections. Think of Visio as a historical machine like old CAD systems, one needs to undo the last of a trail before correcting the earlier ones.
</p>
<p>(From Tom) On the bright side, although the crashes are annoying I have
rarely lost work after a crash.</p>
