  Purpose: A listing of modules to be published as a Part 1000 change request
           Note - to generate an ant build for this package, run:
              ant -buildfile buildbuild.xml
           This will create the build.xml file.
           Then run: 
              ant all
           to create the HTML files of the individual modules
           See: readme.txt for details

     publication_index has the following attributes
           name
               The name of the publication set.
           wg.number.publication_set 
               The WG number for the publication set. 
               It should be an integer. 
           wg.number.publication_set_comments 
               The WG number for the addressed ballot comments
           date.iso_submission
               The date the set of parts were submitted to ISO
           date.iso_publication
               The date the set of parts were published by ISO

  <description  xml:space="preserve">
    The modules that are to be added to Part1000 as part of 
    change request CR00004

In addition CR4 contains the following geometric AICs:
- "geometrically_bounded_2d_wireframe" part="503"
- "draughting_annotation" part="504"
- "draughting_elements" part="506"
- "mechanical_design_geometric_presentation" part="517"
- "mechanical_design_shaded_presentation" part="518"
- "associative_draughting_elements" part="520"
- "manifold_subsurface" part="521"
- "curve_swept_solid" part="523"

Because all these are resource parts, it was not possible to use the usual part 1000 publication build. Instead individual build had been created, one for each AIC 
    
The STEPmod CVS repository shoudl be tagged as: CR00004 before submitting the change request
