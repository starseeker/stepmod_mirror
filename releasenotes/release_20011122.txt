- THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WORK RELEASE - IT IS NOT COMPLETE.

- XSL stylesheets for the following have been completed:
   foreword
   introduction
   1 scope 
   2 normative references
   4 Information requirements
   5 Module interpreted model  
   A AM MIM short names
   E AM ARM and MIM EXPRESS listings
  URLs are created for all the EXPRESS displayed in the above sections.

- The stylesheets to deal with the following are still to be done:
  3 Definitions and abbreviations
  B Information requirements object registration
  C ARM EXPRESS-G
  D MIM EXPRESS-G  
  F Application module implementation and usage guide
  Bibliography

- A crude index has been created:
  stepmod/repository_index.xml
  with dtd and stylesheet.

- Directories have been created for all the modules. 

- The EXPRESS for the modules has been copied and converted to XML.
  Note: just the EXPRESS has been converted - NO DESCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN
  CONVERTED. Each module should contain:
    arm.exp
       - the short form EXPRESS for the module ARM.
    arm.xml
       - the XML (with no descriptions yet) generated from arm.exp
    mim.exp
       - the short from EXPRESS for the module MIM
    mim.xml
       - the XML (with no descriptions yet) generated from mim.exp
    mim_lf.exp
       - the long form EXPRESS for the module MIM (short form)
    mim_lf.xml
       - the XML (with no descriptions yet) generated from mim_lf.exp
    module.xml
       - the main text for a module, the scope, introduction etc.
    sys/
       - directory containing auto generated XML files. One for each clause
         of the module.
  
  NOTE: Due to difficulties with CVS - not all the mim_lf files have been
  checked in.

- The module.xml file has been created for each module. However, this is
  just the skeleton structure of the document - THE TEXT OF THE MODULES HAS
  NOT BEEN CONVERTED. 

- Directories have been created for part41 Integrated Resource schemas and
  the express has been converted for each schema. The remaining Integrated
  Resources need to be converted. 

- The table of contents for each module now includes sub sections for
  clause 4 and 5

- The MIM express for:
      process_property_assignment
      property_representation
      shape_property_representation
      independent_property_usage
      geometric_validation_property_representation
      property_assignment_mim
   Should have a  new line after ISO 10303-41 comment. This has been corrected.

- Various utilities have been provided in utils directory for converting
  EXPRESS to XML and generating the HTML.

- A set of help files have been started. These are by no means complete or
  adequate
