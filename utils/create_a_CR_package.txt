provides detailed step by step instructions to build a CR and evaluate it.

Create a CR publication package
–Requires ANT and Java and Saxon 6.5.5
–Run: stepmod\utils\mkpart1000CR.wsf
fill in: "CR00NNN" to create a directory
-read the stepmod\publication\part1000\<CR00NNN>\readme.txt for some instructions.
•Add the docs to the publication
–Edit: stepmod\publication\part1000\<CR00NNN>\publication_index.xml
--get appropriate N numbers from Convener.
-reference stepmod\publication\part1000\CR00009\publication_index.xml for examples.
-note that now we should be able to include modules and resources in a CR build.
-create an empty log file: log.txt in stepmod\publication\part1000\<CR00NNN>\log.txt
•Build the ANT file
–Run: ant –buildfilebuildbuild
•Generate the HTML
–Run: ant all
–Generates: stepmod\publication\isopub\<CR00NNN>
-review the contents of the log.txt file for real errors due to missing modules in publication_index.xml
-or other errors
-commit the contents of stepmod\publication\part1000\<CR00NNN> to CVS.
-review the content of stepmod\publication\isopub\<CR00NNN> for errors.
-fix errors until none.

-for each module in the publication_index.xml execute xslt against 
stepmod/data/modules/<module>/nav/mapping_view_with_test.xml
-look for red marks.
-endfor

retrieve last SMRL and put it somewhere.
copy the stepmod\publication\isopub\<CR00NNN> over the top of previous SMRL


--for each design ap build an ap publication package.
Run:stepmod\utils\mkpublication.wsf
fill in: "APNNN" to create a directory
–Edit: stepmod\publication\<APNNN>\publication_index.xml
-create an empty log file
stepmod\publication\<APNNN>\log.txt
•Build the ANT file
–Run: ant –buildfilebuildbuild
•Generate the HTML
–Run: ant all
–Generates: stepmod\publication\isopub\<APNNN>
-examine the log file for errors that need fixing.
merge the stepmod\publication\isopub\<APNNN> into the previous SMRL
(look to AP242 ed1 directory structure for details)
run linkcheck against the APNNN/index.htm
(I think it is ok to merge multiple APs for testing into one SMRL as they have isolated names)
verify the missing links are only ones related to old link for sc4 directory.
endfor.
