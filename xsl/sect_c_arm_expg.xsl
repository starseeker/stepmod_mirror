        This annex contain two distinct representations of the Application

      <ul>
        <li>
          a schema level representation which depicts the import of the
          constructs defined in the ARM schema of other application modules, in
          the ARM schema of this application module, through USE FROM statements;
        </li> 
        <li>
          an entity level representation which presents the EXPRESS constructs
          defined in the ARM schema of this application module and the
          references to imported constructs that are specialized or referred to
          by the constructs of the ARM schema of this application module.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        <small>
          NOTE&#160;&#160;Both these representations are partial. The schema level
          representation does not present the ARM schema of modules that are
          indirectly imported. The entity level representation does not present
